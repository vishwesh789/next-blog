Probiotics are live microorganisms, basically bacteria, and sometimes yeast that give some sort of positive health benefit to the person taking them. Most of the probiotics end up at the end of your intestinal system, also known as the colon.\n\n The gut microbiome is incredibly important to our health, but we don’t totally understand it just yet. We’ve seen relationships between irregularities in the microbiome and diseases like diabetes, obesity, heart disease, mental conditions like depression, anxiety. The bacteria found within your gut can control your emotions, your depressive, anxiety symptoms, your moods, your appetite even.\n\n There’s seven to 90 different strains of good bacteria inside your gut. Experts deem probiotics to be a safe supplement, yet potential risks exist. The average healthy person should not be taking a daily probiotic. We have not proved it to give enough benefit to warrant the risks and especially spending money on a supplement that may not give you any benefit.","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":6,"dataSources":null,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":7,"attributes":{"title":"Reduce Anxiety & Stress with the Physiological Sigh ","slug":"reduce-anxiety-and-stress-with-the-physiological-sigh","createdAt":"2023-02-02T13:56:39.070Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-04T23:31:30.111Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-02T13:56:41.866Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3094215/pexels-photo-3094215.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Billions of people suffer from stress. And there are tools to combat stress that involve things like meditation, breath work, good nutrition, good social connections, and avoiding all bad things in life. \nAnd while those are powerful, the problem is they require that people step away from the stress inducing activity. My lab and other laboratories have been very interested in developing tools that allow us to push back on stress. \nFeel more calm in real time, meaning without having to disengage from the stress-inducing activity. The best way that I am aware of doing that is called the physiological sigh. A physiological sigh is a pattern of breathing that involves two inhales followed by an extended exhale. \nPhysiological sighs were discovered in the 1930s as a pattern of breathing that people go into spontaneously when they are in claustrophobic environments or in deep sleep. When there's a buildup of a gas called carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, carbon dioxide triggers the impulse to breathe. \nThere are neurons in the brain that know when carbon dioxide levels have gotten too high. And when the levels get too high, they trigger inhale and exhale, or double inhale and exhale. Now, you can do physiological size voluntarily. \nAnytime you're feeling too stressed and you want to feel more calm, you do it like this. So it's a double inhale. And typically the first inhale is longer than the second, but the second one is still important to do, and then a very long extended exhale. \nTypically, both inhales are through the nose and the exhale is through the mouth. That's the most effective way to do the physiological side. However, if you can't breathe through your nose or your mouth, for whatever reason, do it throughout your mouth or throughout your nose. \nThe second inhale is really important because your lungs are not just two big bags of air. They're two big bags of air with lots of little sacks, millions of sacks. And if you were to lay out those sacks, their volume is as big as a tennis court. \nAnd that allows both the intake of more oxygen, but also the offload of carbon dioxide. So when you do the double inhale, it re-inflates any of these little sacks that have collapsed, and in doing so, it allows you to offload more carbon dioxide. \nSo if you're feeling stressed in any circumstance, inhale twice through the nose and then exhale long through the mouth. You can repeat it a second or even a third time. But typically, just one or two, maybe three physiological sighs are sufficient to bring your level of stress and alertness down very fast and allow you to feel more calm. ","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":3,"dataSources":null,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":8,"attributes":{"title":"How to Control Stress in Real-Time","slug":"how-to-control-stress-in-real-time","createdAt":"2023-02-02T14:08:24.693Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-06T03:20:00.435Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-02T16:13:02.774Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/321576/pexels-photo-321576.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"An ability to control your levels of stress in real time is extremely powerful. It turns out you can do this using physiology and neuroscience. Your breathing can directly impact your heart rate and your level of stress, or calm. \n\nHere’s how it’s works. When you inhale, your diaphragm moves down. This creates more space in your thoracic cavity, and your heart actually gets a little bigger. As a result, the rate of blood flow through that larger heart volume slows down. \n\nA signal is sent from a group of neurons on your heart called the sinoatrial node. That signal goes up to the brain, and your brain sends a signal to speed the heart up. In other words, inhaling speeds your heart rate up. \n\nThe opposite is true as well. When you exhale, your diaphragm moves up, your heart gets a little bit smaller because there’s a little bit less space in your thoracic cavity. As a result, blood flows more quickly through that smaller volume. \n\nThe sinoatrial node registers that and signals your brain, and the brain signals to slow the heart down. So, in other words, inhaling speeds your heart rate up. Exhaling slows your heart rate down. \n\nSo if you want to speed up your heart rate and be more alert, inhale more or make those inhales more vigorous, more intense, if you want to calm down, you can do that quickly by making your exhales slightly longer than your inhales or making them more vigorous. \n\nThis doesn’t require any breath work. This is something that you can do in real time, and that’s what’s called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. That’s the technical phrase. It’s also the basis of what’s called heart rate variability, or HRV. \n\nBut all you need to remember is inhaling deeper and longer will speed your heart rate up. Exhaling. Longer and more intensely will slow your heart rate down and will allow you to calm down in real time. ","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":2,"dataSources":null,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":9,"attributes":{"title":"7 Health Benefits of Green Tea & How to Drink it ","slug":"7-health-benefits-of-green-tea-and-how-to-drink-it","createdAt":"2023-02-03T00:43:29.954Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-04T23:25:41.432Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-03T00:43:32.258Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1417945/pexels-photo-1417945.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"This article is going to be all about the health benefits of green tea. I’ve seen some overblown claims, so we’re going to parse through and figure out what’s what. Also, read till the end of the article to get tips on how to make the healthiest cup of tea possible. \n\nTea is one of those rare beverages that’s pretty much universally accepted by science as a healthy one. But just remember. As with everything in. Life, you can have too much of a good thing. So don’t overdo it with the green tea. \n\nThe number one thing that makes green tea so good for you is that it’s loaded with healthy nutrients. All of these bioactive polyphenols are awesome for your health. You may have heard of some of them known as flavonoids or catechins. \n\nAnd what those are just antioxidants. What antioxidants do is prevent free radical damage to your body, and free radical damage to your body over time causes cancer. But let me break that down a bit. \n\nI know all of you have faucets at home, whether it’s in your bathroom or in your kitchen. Some of those faucets have rust on them. The rust is a direct result of that free radical damage we always talk about. \n\nNow, antioxidants prevent that rust from forming. So think of antioxidants as the rust prevention within our own bodies. Within media, it’s been mentioned before that those who drink green tea have lower rates of cancer, and it’s been theorized that it has something to do with the huge amount of antioxidants found within green tea. \n\nWe have to not get too excited by this fact, because this is only a correlation and not a causation. Yes, it’s good to drink green tea, but no, it’s not going to cure and prevent all types of cancer. \n\nSecond significant point about green tea, if you got stinky breath, maybe you should try some green tea. The nutrients within green tea that we just mentioned on this last point, known as catechins, do a great job of inhibiting and killing certain types of bacteria. \n\nIn fact, studies were done and proved that bacteria known to cause bad breath within your mouth was killed by drinking green tea. Also, when you have less of that specific bacteria, you have less plaque. So green tea also decreases the risk of developing a cavity.\n\n Point three about green tea. It does a great job of giving you stable energy without all the jitters. It has about 30 to 50 milligrams of caffeine, which is roughly half a cup of coffee. \n\nYou’re still focused, you’re still stimulated, but you don’t have that jittery feeling that you get yet with a big cup of coffee. Another nutrient within green tea that works together with caffeine to boost your brain function is called Althea. \n\nIts benefit is that it gives your brain relaxation without the added sedation or drowsiness that comes along with other relaxing agents. While we’ve seen in animal and lab models, it increases your good cholesterol and lowers your bad cholesterol, what we found in animal lab and human trials is that green tea lowers your blood pressure. \n\n Point number five: green tea can help you burn fat. Well, this is more of an individual case-by-case basis thing, because not all studies agree on this. \n\nBut there is a promise of increased metabolism and fat oxidation, essentially fat burning. Some of the lab models have shown a decrease in new blood vessel formation within your fat stores, meaning that it literally takes away the vital nutrition for your fat and makes it die. \n\nPoint number six: Animal and lab models both show that catechins the nutrient we keep mentioning repeatedly decrease the risk of you developing Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Science isn’t clear on why this occurs, but it’s theorized that it has something to do with the decrease in the development of plaque within the brain. If that doesn’t encourage you to take a sip, I don’t know what will.\n\nPoint 7: Now, this is the game changer. This is the one that everyone gets excited about. Green tea may increase your lifespan. There’s been a ton of research done on this. \n\nSome studies even have 40,000 participants that show those who drink three to five cups of tea a day have an increased lifespan, have a decreased all, cause mortality. That means dying from anything, has decreases in heart disease, decreases in strokes. \n\nBut before we get too excited, we need to remember correlation versus causation. Just because those who drink green tea live longer, it doesn’t mean green tea is the sole thing that’s responsible for that effect. \n\nSo, yes, enjoy your green tea, but don’t think you’re going to live forever. Here’s how you create the healthiest cup of tea possible. Don’t add green tea directly to boiling water as it destroys those healthy categories we’ve been talking about. \n\nDon’t go decaf because the decaffeination process hurts more of the nutrients found in green tea. Add lemon into your tea as it aid in the absorption of some of these nutrients.  ","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":5,"dataSources":null,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":10,"attributes":{"title":"Intermittent Fasting: Pros and cons","slug":"intermittent-fasting-pros-and-cons","createdAt":"2023-02-03T01:44:22.565Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-04T23:30:43.135Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-03T01:52:01.953Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/70497/pexels-photo-70497.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Our bodies enter a fasting state every time we’re asleep. Some people do intermittent fasting and do not even know it. I mean, there’s plenty of times where I had a stressful rotation in medical school or a difficult job in the hospital where I didn’t have time to eat breakfast. \n\nThat’s a form of intermittent fasting. And our bodies are totally capable of handling this. I know what you’re thinking. I don’t want to starve myself for health benefits. Intermittent fasting is not starving. \n\nWhen you’re fasting, your body is using stored nutrients and stored energy forms in order to make your body continue to function. When you’re starving, you run out of those energy sources and are breaking down vital tissues like organs to get that same energy. \n\nThere are many different ways to go about going on one of these diets. And that not only makes it confusing for you, but that also makes it very difficult to do research on it to find out how effective it truly is. \n\nBecause if there are multiple ways to do it, we have to be able to test each one of those ways. The 16/8 diet which is not eating during 16 hours of the day. Alternate day fasting, where you eat one day fast, the other day five and two were two days of the week that you’re fasting. \n\nThere’s no hard and fast rule saying that this is the correct way of doing it. You may be wondering how is IF beneficial to me? There’s been a lot of proposed health benefits. Many of them have been proven within animal studies or lab models, which is not the same thing as being proven in a human model, but they are very promising. \n\nNow, those benefits include increased mental sharpness, a favorable hormonal profile, weight loss. Decreases of inflammation within the body, decreases of certain diseases within the body. How can IF help you lose weight? \n\nYou have an increase in growth hormone, a decrease in insulin, and that alone will help you lose weight. Next, because you’re skipping meals or even going days without eating meals, it’s very likely that when you look throughout the week, you’ll be eating fewer calories. \n\nOur thinking is that during 8 hours you’ll eat less than you would if you were eating during 16 hours. Let’s talk about these other health benefits. We know that chronic stress is not good for the body. \n\nThe body is just not meant to be chronically stressed out. It’s not meant to have a high heart rate, high blood pressure. Intermittent fasting is really a form of acute short term mild stress. This type of acute short term stress is really good for the body. \n\nWhat can we use as a metaphor here? Let’s take exercise. Exercise is a form of acute mild stress. What happens after exercise? We have benefits for the brain. We have benefits for weight loss. We have benefits for disease prevention. \n\nNow, similarly, when you stress your body through intermittent fasting, there are some benefits. More autophagy, which is the removal of cellular waste, more production of neurotrophic factors, which protect your brain, and a favorable hormonal profile with increases in human growth hormone and norepinephrine. \n\nLet’s talk about some of the shortcomings of IF. Primarily, there’s not enough guidance on what you should eat. We don’t know how many calories. We don’t know what foods to eat on the days or times that you actually are eating. \n\nSecond, we don’t know which form of IF is best. Third, there are some side effects when you are fasting that people do experience heading aches, mental fog, heartburn. These things do exist. It’s not totally benign. \n\nFour. We don’t know the consequences of following an intermittent fasting diet long term. Most, if not all, of these studies are done on the short term. If you are eating a very unhealthy diet and then make a change, you’re definitely going to see a benefit. ","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":4,"dataSources":null,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":11,"attributes":{"title":"I went VEGAN For 30 Days | Here's How My Body Reacted...","slug":"i-went-vegan-for-30-days-here-s-how-my-body-reacted","createdAt":"2023-02-03T04:11:22.897Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-04T23:30:13.831Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-03T04:11:25.351Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1351238/pexels-photo-1351238.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Honestly, I was really proud of myself, and it’s nice every now and then to take a challenge like this and learn something new about yourself.  \nFive things I Learned to be vegan for 30 days ...\nIn fact, I want to tell you five things that I learned not only about the vegan diet but also about myself during this process. One, when I didn’t plan well; I ate very unhealthy when I was at MIT for breakfast. I ate cinnamon toast Crunch with almond milk and a banana every morning. That’s not healthy, even though it’s vegan. \nTwo, I didn’t notice a major change in my energy level like I thought I would. I mean, maybe I had a slightly decreased energy level, but we remember I was sick in the beginning. I was under eating calories, so I don’t feel it’s fair to blame vegan for that. \n\nThree, surprisingly, I didn’t get weaker on vegan. I was lifting strong, and I felt good. But what suffered was getting to the gym. I really noticed the lack of willpower when I was following the restrictive diet. \nFour, when it comes to my body, I lost 3 pound. I dropped from 203 to 200 pounds. So there was some weight loss, probably from under-eating calories, but despite losing weight, I didn’t feel as lean. I mean, all those sauces, all the rice that I ate, pasta that contributed to the car bloat and probably made me feel a little bit pudgier than usual. \nFive, this is the big one. The real difficulty was my GI system. I mean, it was a mess. The amount of gas and flatulence and bloating. God, I can’t. It’s, like, gross even talking about, but it was terrible. \n\nIf you have that with any diet, there’s no way you’re sticking with it. And I tried taking some over-the-counter supplements for this. It did absolutely nothing.\n\nMy advice to you .....\nIf you’re curious or interested in starting a vegan diet, I don’t want to dissuade you. In fact, I want to encourage you. Go talk to a dietitian nutritionist physician, someone who’s well versed in vegan diets. That way you could do it the healthy, happy, safe way without hurting yourself in the process. \nAnd please reduce the amount of refined carbs and processed foods that you’re eating, because as more research comes out, that’s the stuff that causes diseases and shortens your lifespan.

There’s some really interesting relationships between the gallbladder and your thyroid. So let’s first start out talking about what is bile. Bile is composed of many things.\n\nYou, first of all, have bile salts in the bile, and that’s made out of potassium, sodium, calcium. So 67% of bile is bile salts. But then you also have something else in bile salts, and that’s called lecithin. So 22% of bile is made out of lecithin, and lecithin is a choline compound that helps you break down fat and cholesterol.\n\nSo bile is made out of bile salts, lecithin, which has choline in it. Also, bile is made up of cholesterol. And that’s really how bile salts are created from cholesterol. And if there’s too much cholesterol and not enough bile salts, that’s when you get gallstones.\n\nSo we have the cholesterol. Now, the protein is mainly two amino acids that combined with this bile to allow it to be water soluble and transported through the body. So that allows it to travel through the body in a very similar way to cholesterol being attached to a protein. So cholesterol is really, really important.\n\nNow, what’s interesting about the thyroid is when the thyroid is low, you have this hypothyroid condition, and even if it’s subclinical, so it’s not like a major problem. It’s a smaller problem that is going into the direction of a full-blown hypothyroid situation. Here you are having all this cholesterol in the body, but it’s not really broken down. So you get the situation where you’re getting a buildup of more cholesterol without the bile to break it down.\n\nAnd so, again, we have another risk of getting gallstones because we’re getting more cholesterol. The body can’t use it without the bile salts. So you have this super saturated cholesterol stone that’s developing. Also, your bile ducts won’t be able to relax if the thyroid hormones are sluggish.\n\nIf the thyroid is sluggish, you’re going to be on the cold side. The activation of the enzymes in the liver are not going to be that great as well as the formation of bile. Now, on the flip side, bile salts help in the conversion of T4 to T3 to actually activate the thyroid hormones. T4 is the inactive version of the thyroid hormone, T3 is the active version.\n\n To help this conversion, bile is needed. So you may have a lot of thyroid hormone, like T4, but you can also experience the symptoms of a hypothyroid because you’re not being activated. It takes a really healthy thyroid to make good bile, but it also takes bile to actually create a healthy thyroid. So one big common problem, probably the most common problem with a hypothyroid situation, is that the person has an autoimmune type hypothyroid situation.\n\nIt’s not really a thyroid problem. It’s an immune problem that’s attacking the thyroid. Another common cause of thyroid problems is a high level of cortisol. It’s adrenal stress, and that can shut down the thyroid.\n\nSo the thyroid is secondary, the adernal is primary, and a couple of reasons for that. So if you are on a low-fat diet or a plant-based diet, you’re not going to get enough cholesterol. And that could be the very reason why the adrenals tank down and the thyroid goes down, because you don’t have the raw material to make these hormones. Just by supplying more fat, going on a healthy version of the ketogenic diet can supply the raw material to start making more adrenal hormones.\n\nThat can then reduce the cortisol situation and give relief to your thyroid. And remember, it takes cholesterol to make bile. So being on a low-fat diet or a low-cholesterol diet can cause you not to even make enough bile, cannot activate the thyroid hormones, so we need that cholesterol. Also, what activates the production of bile is fat in the diet, animal fats.\n\nSo if you’re not having enough animal fats, you just don’t make enough bile. That right there can increase your risk of gallstones as well as your risk of getting a hypothyroid situation, because, one, we don’t feed the adrenal hormones, okay, so then we get higher cortisol, and we don’t make enough bile to make the conversion from T4 to T3. Because I think it’s really important to just look at all these factors and figure out what the real problem is instead of just being on your medication for the rest of your life and not really ever coming off of it. One is you don’t have enough selenium in the diet.\n\nYou don’t have enough iodine in the diet, and your estrogen might be too high. So to help you sort out more of really what’s causing your thyroid problem in the first place, you might want to check this article out right here.","tags":["thyroid","gallbladder"],"readTime":7,"dataSources":null,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":16,"attributes":{"title":"Natural and Practical Way to End Stress and Lower Cortisol","slug":"natural-and-practical-way-to-end-stress-and-lower-cortisol","createdAt":"2023-02-06T23:39:37.062Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-06T23:46:25.470Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-06T23:39:40.882Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/4810369/pexels-photo-4810369.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"And as we are more exposed to this threat of danger, it can really affect every single system in our body. But there’s one thing that’s very, very important, and I want to just talk about it, and that's changing your viewpoint about the environment. I know this might be hard to believe, but your environment is not as dangerous as they want you to believe. Recently, I started to really look at the videos and different TV programmes I was watching, and it just hit me how many messages of fear I was exposed to without any solutions.\n\nNow, I’m definitely not saying to ignore some of these dangers, but when you are exposed to them, try like heck to have a relaxed viewpoint, staying in action to help solve the problem and improve things. But at some point, we need to start filtering out this threat of danger because it’s just not healthy for our bodies. You should start watching TV programmes and hang out with people who give you solutions that emphasise the good news. Talk about the good things to offset the massive danger signals that our body is constantly fed.\n\nNow, let me just go through a couple of things, because this is actually a very important topic. That is the flutter fight, the protective mode we enter in response to the threat of stress. Whereas the other system, called the parasympathetic, is all about growth, sleep, digestion, repair, and healing. In practice, I used to have a test called a «heart rate durability test» that would measure how much of the sympathetic nervous system was being activated versus how much parasympathetic.\n\nAnd boy, nearly everyone that came in was just so jacked up to the right, which is Because the environment we're in is considered extremely dangerous, we have sympathetic dominance. I mean, if there aren't enough things going wrong, to have other people manufacture more of them is complete insanity. So, I believe it is critical that you understand what happens to your biology when you are subjected to long-term chronic stress. Let’s go on to the immune system.\n\nStress suppresses the immune system. And therefore, when you go to the doctor and you have inflammation or some type of autoimmune disease, they inject you with prednisone, which takes that away temporarily because prednisone is a type of cortisol that is produced by the adrenal glands, which are activated by stress, and that is suppressing all the immune reactions. You have decreased sperm production. Well, if you’re trying to be on the ketogenic diet, your whole metabolism shifts back to glucose production.\n\nThat’s right, because cortisol is a glucocorticoid, so it increases glucose and neogenesis, the production of new sugar in your liver. So when you go through chronic stress, what’s happening is that you’re just pumping out all this sugar that’s not coming from your diet. Because when you’re in stress mode, your body needs this quick energy. When you go through chronic stress, your triglycerides go up, your HDL goes down, and your LDL goes up.\n\nYour ability to detoxify I’m talking about certain enzymes in your liver. These are the enzymes that convert poisons into harmless, water-soluble things that can be released from the body. Those are inhibited when you go through chronic stress. So there goes the fat digestion.\n\nEven your pancreatic enzymes and the enzymes from your small intestine will be inhibited, cutting down your ability to digest. Your production of hydrochloric acid is going to go down, too. So there goes your complete digestion of proteins, your absorption of minerals, and the killing of pathogens. On top of all the other barriers to vitamin D absorption, stress will actually slow down the absorption of vitamin D. Even the fascia, which is similar to the stuff that surrounds the muscles and is highly innovated by your nerves and brain, has a lot of information coming down to it, around the ligaments, around your muscles, and it tightens and becomes more restricted.\n\nWhen you’re under chronic stress, you maintain this posture right here, which is kind of like being in protection mode. You know, your posture starts going down, and it all has to do with that fascia. In a chronic state of stress, you will not be thinking analytically, thinking about things, solving problems, coming up with good solutions, being creative, or having imagination. Instead, it’s going to be more like reaction mode because you need a relaxed state of mind to come up with solutions.\n\nYou need your creativity to come up with really good strategies and solutions. The last point I want to bring up is your genes. What happens to your genes when you’re under stress? Well, all the bad genes get activated, okay? and all the good genes get suppressed. I’m talking about the activation of cancer genes.\n\nI’m talking about the activation of inflammatory genes and things like that. But one thing I want to bring up is that your genes really don’t cause anything. The genes are associated with a lot of bad things. But if you know how to control your genes, you’re totally going to be in the driver’s seat.\n\nNumber one, we must change our attitude towards our environment. We must also start filtering out the threat of danger to which we’re exposed. If you start watching certain videos that don’t give you a solution and at the end of the video you feel worse than before you watched the video, then you might need to filter those things out. Therapy for me is getting out in nature, getting as much space as possible, and really kind of getting connected to my environment.\n\nNow, the other thing to do is to physically flesh out a lot of this extra adrenaline and this extra cortisol that have been accumulated through the day of exposure to all these things. I mean, I have to physically work out every single day just to kind of flush things out and help me sleep. Because of the other point about the adrenaline and cortisol, it’s shifting a lot of energy that should be in your immune system, should be in repair, should be in digestion, and it’s ending up in the muscles. But because there’s no more tiger around, we have more mental energy, and that whole mechanism is still there.\n\nSo you’re going to have to exercise to get those hormones out of your system. Now, that being said, there are a lot of additional things you can do to help with stress. They're not as important as changing your viewpoint, but they’re still important.\n\n\n","tags":["chronic stress","immune system"],"readTime":11,"dataSources":null,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":17,"attributes":{"title":"The top home treatments for candida fungus:NEVER AGAIN GET CANDIDA","slug":"the-top-home-treatments-for-candida-fungus-never-again-get-candida","createdAt":"2023-02-07T02:58:45.735Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-31T19:25:59.979Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-07T02:58:48.295Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/6436310/pexels-photo-6436310.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Today we'll talk about the best candida treatments.\n\nFungi make up a large portion of the microbes in your gut, and candida is one type of fungi.

Well, when you have sudden cardiac arrests or sudden cardiac death, you die right away. But when you have a heart attack, you may not die right away. \n\n\n\nIt’s usually involving an obstruction in the coronary artery that goes to the heart muscle itself. But with these other conditions, the electrical system of the heart just shuts down, and for the majority of time, it’s called idiopathic, which means they don’t know what causes it. \n\n\n\nSo I want to talk about the relationship between Omega-3 fatty acids and the electrical system of the heart, as well as how you can use fish oils to decrease the risk of sudden cardiac arrest or death. \n\n\n\nSo what is so special about these Omega-3 fish oils that you keep hearing about over and over and over, and how do they help you as far as the heart function?\n\n\n\nWell, first of all, they have several properties that involve the heart. \n\n\n\nAntiarrhythmic\n\n\n\nThey’re antiarrhythmic, which means they help the heart stay in rhythm.\n\n\n\nAnti-inflammatory\n\n\n\nThey’re anti-inflammatory, which anytime you reduce inflammation to the heart, you’re going to help the heart function. And if the inflammation goes too long, you can get fibrosis to the heart. \n\n\n\nTrigger Genes\n\n\n\nAnd it just so happens that these fish oils trigger genes that turn off the fibrosis effect of the heart.\n\nAntithrombotic\n\n\n\nFish oils are also antithrombotic, which means that they inhibit this thrombus or this clot formation. \n\n\n\nSo they help keep the blood on the thinner side so it doesn’t clot unnecessarily, even though if there’s a problem in the artery, you want it to clot. But fish oils can help prevent this inappropriate clotting. \n\n\n\nSupport the Endothelial layer\n\n\n\nFish oils also support this endothelial layer on the inside of your arteries, which is going to help your blood pressure, and it’s also going to prevent the formation of calcium and cholesterol from forming inside of the arteries. \n\n\n\nMake your cell membranes more fluid and less rigid\n\n\n\nBut despite all that, I think the biggest benefit that fish oils can do for your heart is make your cell membranes very fluid and less rigid. If we look at the opposite of Omega-3, we’re dealing with omega-6 fatty acids.\n\n\n\nAnd that would be all the seed oils, the vegetable oils, the soy oil, the cotton seed, safflower, sunflower oil, peanut oil. All these oils invade the cell membrane and make them more rigid. It’s extremely important that you have the ratios of omega-6 to Omega-3 correct. \n\n\n\nAnd they really should be like a one to one ratio. An average person in the US has like a 15 to 1 ratio to Omega-3 fatty acids. And so you can imagine the stiff arteries, you can imagine all the other problems that occur with these Omega-6. \n\n\n\nIncreasing insulin resistance, increasing the risk of obesity, increasing the risk of getting a fatty liver, and the list goes on and on and on. So based on that data, you might think, well, okay, well, I’m doing fish oils, I’m doing supplements, you stay, I’m fine. \n\n\n\nBut what you may not know is there’s a lot of the hidden sources of omega-6  fatty acids. And this omega-6 fatty acids compete with Omega-3. So the more that the omega-6 are in the diet, the less you’re going to get off the Omega-3. \n\nSo if you’re doing both of these at the same time, you’re really nullifying the effects of Omega-3. And this is very important to know.\n\n\n\nSo let’s go through some of the foods or the hidden foods that are high in Omega-6. \n\n\n\nWell, you have all the animals that are fed grains, like the commercial chicken, the commercial chicken-eggs, grain fed beef versus the grass fed beef. All of these are very high in omega-6. \n\n\n\nAll the grains, the bread, the pasta, the cereal, the crackers, are very high in Omega-6. Most of the nuts are high in Omega-6, except for walnuts do have a precursor to the Omega-3 fatty acids.\n\n\n\nAnd then what about all the salad dressings? \n\n\n\nTry to find a salad dressing that does not have vegetable oil. You want to make your own out of extra virgin olive oil and vinaigrette.\n\n\n\nThen we have the condiments like mayonnaise that’s usually made of soy oil. \n\n\n\nTry to find a mayonnaise that doesn’t have Omega-6 oils.\n\n\n\nWhat about hummus? Right? You buy hummus for yourself to dip your cucumbers. I mean, it’s very difficult to find hummus without Omega-6 oils. For some reason, they just don’t add the olive oil in the recipe. \n\n\n\nWell, I know the reason is just because it’s too expensive. But you want hummus with extra virgin olive oil, not soy oil or safflower oil.\n\n\n\nNow, farm-raised fish does, by the way, have more Omega-3 fatty acids than wild caught fish. \n\n\n\nHowever, it also has six times higher Omega-6 fatty acids than wild caught fish.\n\n\n\nAnd then we have restaurant food. I mean, it’s just loaded with Omega-6 fatty acids and the oils and fast food, especially typical French fries, deep fried and all the Omega-6 oils. \n\n\n\nSo this is a very important article. If you don’t know this information, start increasing your fish oils. Cognitive oil is a little bit better because it not only has the Omega-3 fatty acids, but it also has vitamin D and vitamin A, whereas fish oils don’t. \n\n\n\nHowever, fish oils are still good. Make sure you include salmon or fatty fish while caught in your diet on a regular basis.\n\n\n\nBut more importantly, really start avoiding these Omega-6 fats that seem to creep into our diet so often. \n\n\n\nAnd on top of that, it’s fascinating to me how the so called nutritional experts will tell you that you need to replace your saturated fats with the Omega-6. When there’s absolutely no evidence to show that’s going to improve your heart, shape or form. \n\n\n\nNow, if you haven’t read my article on COD liver oil, you should check that out. I put it up right here. \n","tags":["fish oil","omega-3"],"readTime":5,"dataSources":["https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Omega-3-fatty-acids%2C-acute-coronary-syndrome%2C-and-Harris-Schacky/c3b80d979cceb20fa0c16a55b3eface464c6babb","https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2012.00088/full","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/OMEGA%2C-a-Randomized%2C-Placebo-Controlled-Trial-to-of-Rauch-Schiele/0176a28bcc9bb59ca4c29ffe4c4319c07f808043","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3335257/","https://norwayomega.com/blog/the-differences-between-farmed-wild-salmon-wild-anchovies/"],"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":26,"attributes":{"title":"Why eating everything in moderation doesn’t work for weight loss or creating a healthy body?","slug":"why-eating-everything-in-moderation-doesn-t-work-for-weight-loss-or-creating-a-healthy-body","createdAt":"2023-02-16T19:48:53.166Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-16T19:48:56.090Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-16T19:48:56.084Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1153367/pexels-photo-1153367.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"So today we're going to discuss some really, really bad advice that is everything should be consumed in moderation.

It can be due to several causes, which can include congenital abnormalities, hormonal abnormalities, previous surgeries, or cancer.  \n\n\n\nBut today we’re going to talk about people who have a normal penile length. \n\n\n\nSo while it is true that the large majority of people who are concerned with the size of their penis have a normal penal length based on these numbers, the true issue is that a significant portion of men can have distress related to the idea that their penis is not as long as they desire.  \n\n\n\nAnd this is a form of body dysmorphic disorder, actually has a term, it’s called small penis anxiety. Doesn’t mean that they have a small penis, but they have anxiety related to the fact that they believe that the size of their penis is not long enough.  ","tags":["penile lenth"],"readTime":9,"dataSources":["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2050052119300125?via%3Dihub"],"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":30,"attributes":{"title":"What should be the Duration of Sex?","slug":"what-should-be-the-duration-of-sex","createdAt":"2023-02-19T00:02:33.947Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-19T00:02:36.807Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-19T00:02:36.804Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/4553619/pexels-photo-4553619.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Today, I’m going to tell you, based on data collected from 500 couples around the world, what is the average length of intercourse? \n\n\n\nIn modern society, we spend a lot of time glorifying what sex should look like, how long it should last, and putting a lot of value on this. But ultimately, all this pressure can have a real detrimental impact on our lives.  \n\n\n\nAnd what you hear about sex is not always accurate, particularly how long someone lasts in bed. \n\n\n\nSo here is true and timed data on what the average length of intercourse actually is. Before I launch into the data, it’s important to define what sex actually means.  \n\n\n\nWell, in this particular study, sex means penetration. So, from the initial penetration to the end of penetration, it does not include foreplay. That does not mean what sex should mean for you, but that’s how they define it in this study.  \n\n\n\nIn the data that I’m presenting, they are specifically talking about sex between men and women. But no matter what the data says, it’s important to communicate with your partner about what their expectations are and what they enjoy in a sexual relationship during intercourse and outside of it, because it’s different for each and every person.  \n\n\n\nAnd in order for you to have a fulfilling sex life, it’s important to communicate and always be open. \n\n\n\nSo what do men think the ideal length of penetrative intercourses? Specifically, in medical speak, we call it intra ejaculatory latency time.  \n\n\n\nIt is essentially the time from the beginning of penetration to ejaculation. And on average, they estimate the ideal length to be about 16 minutes. And the actual length, what they think people actually last for, is about 9 minutes.  \n\n\n\nBut what’s the data says? \n\n\n\nSo, if you look at these 500 couples from around the world, they were actually asked to use a stopwatch to time their intra ejaculatory latency time. What they found was the average length was 5.7 minutes.  \n\n\n\nThere was a range which included anywhere from 0.1 minute to about 55 minutes. So some people had longer intra ejaculatory latency time. \n\n\n\nAnd interestingly, it varied by location.  \n\n\n\nSo Turkey had the lowest IELT of 4.4 minutes and the UK had the longest IELT of about 10 minutes. \n\n\n\nSo that’s what the average sex duration is? And what do women want? \n\n\n\nWell, there’s no good scientific study on this, but on a poll which was done by a website of 4000 women, what they found was the average length of time that women desire to have penetrative intercourse was 25 minutes.  \n\n\n\nAgain, this is variable from person to person.

Can your bladder actually burst?\n\nAnd today I’m going to answer just that. \n\nSo what happens when your bladder fills is that your bladder has receptors and these receptors send signals to the brain.  \n\nThat brain then sends you signals of urge. It might be, hey, I think you should maybe go to the bathroom soon. And soon it becomes, hey, you should go very suits. And other times it’s like, hey, you better go or you’re going to pee your pants right?

And so then you continue doing whatever it is you’re doing, like watching a movie or writing a paper or whatever it is that you can’t get up from. \n\nAnd then eventually the urge comes back and then you go again and do the same thing. And I’m sure everyone watching here has held their urine at some point for several hours, right?

Does it take you long to ejaculate or you never get there? Read this article until the end and learn what causes delayed ejaculation and what you can do to treat it.\n\nDelayed Ejaculation: What can you do about it?  \n\nAre you having a hard time finishing? Well, today we’re going to talk about delayed ejaculation. \n\nDefinition of Delayed Ejaculation\n\nSo, delayed ejaculation is a condition where it takes a man longer than usual to achieve climax and ejaculate, and usually the number that we see is anywhere between 20 and 30 minutes.  \n\nHowever, the clinical definition is a little bit more stringent, and it is a marked delay or marked  infrequency of ejaculation that has occurred almost 75% to 100% of the time in the last six months, and that causes the individual distress or bother.  \n\nAnd this is pretty uncommon. It occurs in about 1% of men where they have a lifelong delayed ejaculation and 4% of men where they get acquired delayed ejaculation. \n\nIn this article, we’re going to cover the physiology of erection, the causes, the diagnosis, and the treatment options for delayed ejaculation. So make sure to stick around until the end. \n\nDefinition of Ejaculation\n\nSo ejaculation is the process of releasing semen from the body, and it occurs in many steps. The first step is emission, where semen enters the urethra through the ejaculatory duct and the bladder neck closes to make sure that your semen will not go backwards into the bladder.  \n\nAnd the process of expulsion, where the semen is pushed out through the urethra, usually with the support of the pelvic floor muscles and the muscles around the urethra called the bubble cavernosis muscles.  \n\nInterestingly, ejaculation is a reflex. Once you get to the point where your body sends signals to your spinal cord and then to your brain that you need to ejaculate, ejaculation occurs and there’s nothing you can do to stop it.  \n\nAnd typically, orgasm occurs at the same time as ejaculation. But orgasm is a brain triggered event whereas ejaculation is a spinal cord triggered event. And so these can occur her most often together, but not always.  \n\nAnd specifically, some hormones, like dopamine, are increased during orgasm, whereas other hormones, like prolactin, are suppressed. So some of the medical treatments, all of which are off label, kind of try to work with these hormones to help improve the time to ejaculation and orgasm.  \n\nWhat causes delayed ejaculation?\n\n Well, there’s a number of different causes. It can be psychological, meaning that it’s due to something in your brain or something that’s bothering you in your brain or it can be physiological, meaning that’s from your body and sometimes it can be a combination of both.  \n\nPsychological issues\n\nSo psychological issues can be many. It can be due to certain fears you have. It can be due to having strong religious convictions or guilt associated with ejaculation. It can be due to relationship conflicts.  \n\nIt can be due to idiosyncratic masturbation techniques which I’ve talked about before in my article about when the small chances where masturbation can become harmful. It can be due to performance anxiety. Or the lack of stimulation or arousal. So all of these things can contribute to a psychological delayed ejaculation. \n\n Physiological causes, meaning from your body that you cannot control can be due to things like having surgery which affects the nerves that carry those signals to the spinal cord to cause the ejaculatory reflex or having medical conditions like multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury where we see this quite often.  ","tags":["ejaculation"],"readTime":7,"dataSources":null,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":34,"attributes":{"title":"According to an Urologist, 10 Amazing Ways to Increase Your Sexual Pleasure","slug":"according-to-an-urologist-10-amazing-ways-to-increase-your-pleasure","createdAt":"2023-02-22T23:31:02.271Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-22T23:31:03.956Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-22T23:31:03.953Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/4541585/pexels-photo-4541585.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Are you satisfied with the state of your sexual relationship?\nOr would you like to give it a little more boost?

And as they differentiate into a female and a male fetus, they then develop a clitoris or a penis.  \n\nAnd they both have the exact same structures. Essentially, they have corporate cavernosa which fills and expands with blood when aroused and they extend in size. In fact, for a long time, people thought that the clitoris had about 8000 neurofibers. \n\nA recent study published out of the Oregon Health Sciences University, looking at clitoral tissue under microscopes found that it has an average of 10,000 neurons in the clitoris, meaning is it highly sensitive and probably the only organ that’s ever been identified that’s made purely for pleasure purposes.  \n\nThe clitoris has a foreskin. \n\nThis is called the clitoral hood or prep use, and it’s actually there to protect the clitoris from infection or irritation. It’s very similar to the foreskin of the penis.  \n\nIn fact, sometimes that prep use or clitoral hood can develop inflammation from oil, build up or dead skin cells and cause pain, discomfort or even adhesions between the clitoris itself and the hood.  \n\nThis is kind of similar to what we’d call smegma in men, which can be uncomfortable and make erections and pleasure sometimes difficult. In women, this can sometimes have no symptoms at all. Or other times it can be painful around the clitoris or when someone touches the clitoris or it can make it more difficult to achieve orgasm.  \n\nIn patients who have these problems, there is an in office-based procedure called clitoral adhesiolysis that can be done to free the glands of the clitoris from the hood itself. And while this is not a highly studied area, in a study of 41 women, the responses after this procedure were actually quite good. \n\n76% reported improvement in pain. 63% reported improvement in sexual arousal. Overall, the large majority were really satisfied with sex after the procedure and with their decision to have the procedure.  \n\nThe Labia minora, or the inner lips of the vagina, can vary from person to person. \n\n The labia minora are kind of like a fingerprint. They come in all different shapes, colors, sizes, thicknesses, and they’re unique to you, just like your fingerprint.  \n\nNot everyone looks alike. In fact, many of the images you see in pornography are digitally mastered to make them look a certain way. Many women can have labor labia minora that protrude outside the outer lips or can even be asymmetrical. So they have one that’s longer, or they have more on one side than the other. \n\nInterestingly, during arousal, the labia minora can grow up to two to three times larger than usual. And they can also change color.  \n\nThey usually change from a pinkish color to an intense red color right before orgasm. And the good news is, all these changes are just temporary. After sex, these things go completely back to normal. \n\nThe vagina increases in width and length when preparing for sex. \n\nThe walls of the vagina send signals to the brain telling it, hey, we’re ready. And a couple of things happen. Your body starts producing lubrication in the vagina, and also the vagina increases in width and length.  \n\nIn the non-aroused state, the vagina is about 3 to 4 cm wide and 8 to 9 cm in length. However, this can increase in up to twice its size to be ready to accommodate an erect penis. And after sex, it all goes back to normal.  \n\nSo there is no such thing as getting a loose vagina from having sex. Your body is extremely adaptable and malleable. \n\nThe vagina is self-cleaning and has its own bacteria. \n\nThe vaginal environment is very protective.  \n\nIn fact, because of the estrogen in the vagina, the vagina typically creates an acidic environment. It also has very special bacteria that help protect the vagina’s microbiome. This helps prevent infection and prevent any bad bacteria from entering the vagina.  \n\nIf you’re suffering from recurrent yeast infection, infections or bacterial infections, or even recurrent urinary tract infections, it’s typically a sign there’s something abnormal in the microbiome.  \n\nIn fact, a very easy treatment for prevention of recurrent UTIs is using vaginal estrogen. Particularly in women who no longer make enough estrogen, like those who are postmenopausal, have had surgery or on medications that reduce their estrogen. \n\nIt’s really important not to clean inside the vagina. Your vagina does it itself, so things like douching are really not recommended. And if you want to clean down there, you want to take soapy water and let it run down the outside and only clean the hair-bearing areas, the vagina will take care of itself.  \n\nIt doesn’t need to smell like flowers or roses or vanilla or candy or anything like that. It has its own smell, and it is perfect just the way it is. \n\nAll right, guys, I hope you all found this very helpful, as always, when we take care of yourself. ","tags":["vagina"],"readTime":4,"dataSources":["https://academic.oup.com/jsm/article/19/9/1412/6961320?login=false","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ca.22177","https://issmsmsna2022.org/program/program/?persons=4928&q"],"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":36,"attributes":{"title":"Are you fed up with your sexless marriage?

In fact, 233 studies over the course of almost 50 years and looked at what happened to total sperm count and sperm concentration.  \n\nAnd these, if you don’t know, are essentially parameters that we look at when we get semen analyses to assess if people are maybe subfertile or infertile and maybe contributing to difficulty having a child.  \n\nThey specifically looked at studies that didn’t include men who were there for infertility. They included two groups. One, that was kind of unselected, meaning it was like a young group of men in the military getting semen analyses to start their jobs.  \n\nAnd the other group was men who were fertile. Either men who had a biological child or their partner were pregnant with their biologic child. \n\nAnd importantly, they must have actually produced a sample in the normal way, meaning they had to masturbate. They couldn’t have used some other way to receive a sample. \n\nAnd what they found is really shocking that from the years of 1973 to 2018, sperm counts dropped by 50% and total sperm concentrations decreased by 62%. That is insane. \n\nTo be specific, sperm counts went from 101 million per ml to 49 million per ml. And total sperm concentration went from 335 million to 126 million. \n\n This was specifically in the unselected cohort, meaning the men who were just getting semen analyses for whatever reason not in the fertile group.  \n\nIn fact, the fertile group didn’t really have much of a change in their semen analysis over those 50 years or it was much, much less. And this study was really well done. They were very strict in their inclusion criteria and their statistics were spot on.  \n\nSperm count for men\n\nAnd furthermore, they actually saw other studies that had looked at this similar question and saw similar declines. So yes, sperm counts are going down, but what does that even mean? \n\nSo in fact, while the numbers are getting lower, they’re still not in the infertile range.  \n\nWe know that above 40 million per ml it’s pretty easy for men to father children and in fact; we don’t even get worried until they’re below 15 million /ml so we’re still in a good range. \n\nAnd this study is done over 50 years. And over 50 years, the way we analyze sperm has changed over time and so it may not be comparing apples to oranges all the time. \n\nWhen you look at least the United States data on the number of couples that have been infertile from 2002 until now, that number hasn’t really changed.  \n\nAnd infertile means they’ve been trying to conceive for twelve months or more and haven’t had a positive pregnancy. \n\nSo what does this mean for men’s health and men worldwide? \n\n Well, in fact, there have been some very good studies that have been done in the past that have linked poor sperm parameters to mortality. That means death. \n\nWhy would that even make sense? Like, why would lower sperm parameters mean that you’re more likely to die from any cause? \n\n Why do men think their sperm is declining?\n\nOne of the reasons people think that men are having declining sperm counts is because their mothers in utero, when they’re in utero, are exposed to endocrine disrupting chemicals or have exposure to estrogens which then affect them later on in life.  \n\nAnd these exposed exposures can also cause problems down the line with their health. \n\nAnother reason is that typically the problems that cause issues with sperm are due to defects in DNA. So DNA is the building blocks for our cells.  \n\nAnd so usually the cells for sperm are different from the cells from your body because they carry half the genetic materials as the cells in your entire body. But it’s possible that the things causing DNA damage in the sperm are also causing DNA damage in the rest of your body, which may eventually lead to problems like cancers.  \n\nAnother theory is that these abnormalities in sperm arm are caused by lower testosterone. And I’ve written tons of articles on low testosterone, but low testosterone is a risk factor for having issues with your heart and causing cardiovascular disease.  \n\nAnd so perhaps these men who have lower semen parameters also have lower testosterone, which over time may link them to heart disease and other things that will lead to death. \n\nAnd lastly, we know that there are certain lifestyle factors that will cause both issues with mortality and issues with sperm production.  \n\nFor example, smoking. Smoking will cause you to have poor sperm production and ultimately will cause many, many problems with your health, including heart disease, high blood pressure potential, lung cancer, bladder cancer and so much more. So if you’re reading this, quit smoking today. \n\nSo what does the data tell us? \n\n There are two good studies that have looked at sperm concentration and linked it to mortality. \n\nSo in a group of 40,000 Danish men, they looked at sperm concentration and they tracked these men for 40 years.  \n\nAnd they found that those who had better sperm parameters, higher sperm concentrations, or higher quality sperm tend to live longer. And those with lower quality sperm, particularly around 40 million /ml or less, were likely to have higher rates of mortality.  \n\nInterestingly, the deaths that were seen in the study were kind of very diverse. They weren’t specifically deaths that were associated with things like smoking or lifestyle or heart disease that you could get from having low testosterone, none of that.  \n\nSo the thought is that maybe sperm quality is actually like a biomarker for how healthy you are. \n\n And also it wouldn’t be due to things that were from in utero because some of the theories also suggest that in utero exposures may lead to heart disease and diabetes down the line as well. And they didn’t see that specifically. \n\n 12,000 men, they looked at their rates of mortality and what they found was that even after controlling for all these diseases, men who had had lower sperm counts had a 2.3 fold higher risk of death compared to those who had normal semen parameters.  \n\nHowever, this could be a signal that there is something that we need to pay attention to, that perhaps we should look at which things in our environment may be causing sperm counts to go down and try to fix those.  \n\nWhat can you do to raise your sperm count?\n\n I’ve written an article on optimizing your sperm health and you can check that out as the article. It’s actually very informative and very good, but I’ll cover a few things right here.  \n\nNumber one is environmental factors. \n\nIf you’re getting exposed to certain chemicals in the workplace like pesticides or other toxins that can obviously affect sperm production. \n\nSperm is produced in the testicles, which hang outside the body for a reason.  \n\nThey need a very specific environment to thrive in, which means they are very sensitive to any sort of what we call oxidative stress. And that can be from anything in our environment. That includes things like chemicals, pesticides and including things that are called endocrine disrupting chemicals.  \n\nMost often, you’ll see them described as BPA or phthalates in plastics and things like that. So avoiding those sorts of things in your environment can be very helpful. \n\nI often tell my patients, try not to eat out of plastic. If you get something in a plastic container, transfer it to a glass. If you have a bottle, make sure it’s in a glass bottle or a metal bottle instead of using a plastic water bottle. \n\nAnother thing is, what are you putting in your body?  \n\nSmoking obviously, we’ve discussed this a very strong predictor of having poor sperm production because it’s a toxin. Similarly, excess alcohol can cause the same problem. It can cause reduced sperm production. \n\nAnd food, so there’s not a lot of data on specific diets. But the most studied diet is the Mediterranean diet, which is rich in healthy oils like avocado and olive oil and nuts and seeds and unprocessed grains, unprocessed foods and things like fish.  \n\nI think the key is to have a plant forward diet. Eat lots of vegetables, lots of fruits, and things that are unprocessed. \n\n Stress is another big factor. Obviously, our lives are getting more and more stressful as time goes on, with electronic devices demanding our attention all the time.  \n\nBeing accessible to people all the time can add to a lot of stress in our day, so finding ways to reduce stress on a daily basis is really, really valuable. \n\n And lastly, try to avoid hot tubs or saunas, particularly if you’re trying to conceive.  \n\nExposing your testicles to hot temperatures for long periods of time will reduce sperm production. So trying to stay away from those for long periods of time can be helpful, especially if you’re trying to have a baby.  \n","tags":["sperm count"],"readTime":8,"dataSources":null,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":38,"attributes":{"title":"How can a back or brain injury permanently alter your bladder? | Neurogenic bladder types","slug":"how-can-a-back-or-brain-injury-permanently-alter-your-bladder-neurogenic-bladder-types","createdAt":"2023-02-25T23:04:12.721Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-25T23:04:21.016Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-25T23:04:21.013Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/7430447/pexels-photo-7430447.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Did you know that having a condition that affects your brain or spinal cord can actually affect the way your bladder functions? \n\nNeurogenic Bladder\n\nAnd today I’m going to talk about neurogenic bladder or essentially problems that affect the bladder due to neurologic conditions such as spinal cord injuries, strokes, diabetes and multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease. \n\nSo, to start off, when you think of the body, essentially parts of the brain, the spinal cord, all send nerves and signals to the bladder.  \n\nAnd when there’s any disruption in either the brain, the spinal cord, or the nerves that go to the bladder, it can cause problems with the way the bladder functions. \n\nNeurogenic Bladder Anatomy\n\nWhen we think about problems with the bladder, there’s two ways to think about it.  \n\nbladder Image here \n\nSo here’s our bladder. It has two ureters right here, which are the tubes that drain the bladder as well as the bladder itself, and then the outlet or the urethra or p tube, where the urine comes from.  \n\nThis is obviously a female urethra, because a male urethra is much longer. \n\nHowever, you could think about it as a problem with the bladder or a problem with how the urine empties are what we call the outlet of urine.  \n\nYou can have problems with the bladder itself, where either it doesn’t store urine well, meaning that urine is leaking out because the bladder is not able to hold urine well, or there’s a problem with failure to empty, meaning that the bladder is not squeezing to empty the bladder itself.  \n\nYou can also have these same problems, but because of the outlet, it can be that the sphincter, which is inside the urethra that usually helps keep urine in when your bladder is filling and relaxing, when your bladder is peeing, is not functioning appropriately, or it’s very weak, or it can be failure to empty, meaning sphincter doesn’t relax when it should. \n\nSo, like I said, when you’re peeing, the sphincter relaxes and it allows urine to empty out. And it really depends on what kind of injury you have if what problem will happen? Will it affect the bladder or the outlet? \n\nMost common neurologic conditions\n\nI’m going to go over some of the most common conditions and what we often see as problems with these conditions. \n\n First type of neurologic conditions we think of is those that affect the brain.  \n\nIt can be things like stroke, can be things like Parkinson’s disease, and can be things like trauma to the brain. If you’ve had a brain injury or even dementia. \n\nIn these patients, how I describe it to them is that typically our brain has a break. The break is on the bladder, so the bladder can fill and not contract. And when the bladder is full, it sends signals to the brain. The brake comes off, the bladder squeezes and it empties. \n\nBut the brake is broken because there’s a problem with the brain.  \n\nAnd so now the bladder essentially squeezes before it’s full, giving you this constant urge to urinate. So you got to, got to go, got to go. You can’t make it to the bathroom and often you’re having leakage. Also, patients will experience frequency like needing to go to the bathroom very often and sometimes even at night. \n\n The next category of conditions is called spinal cord injury. \n\nAnd spinal cord injuries, it really depends where they are in the spinal cord.  \n\nAre they in the top part of the spinal cord, what we call supra sacral, or are they at the very low part of the spinal cord where they’re Infasacral. In those who have supra sacral injuries, we see patients who have issues with not only that bladder problem where they’re going very often because their bladder is squeezing before it’s ready.  \n\nBut we also have a problem with the sphincter. The sphincter is often not relaxing in time when you need to empty. So they’ll feel a lot of urge to go but then they can’t empty because the sphincter doesn’t relax, it’s not coordinated with the brain.  \n\nAnd so this creates a lot a problem and in fact it’s quite dangerous because what happens is you’re getting all this pressure from the bladder squeezing and your sphincter is not opening. So where does that pressure go?  \n\nWell, if you remember how the bladder is, it’s going to go up these tubes, up the ureters and they’re attached to the kidneys up here and so that can create long-term problems. \n\nSo if you have a spinal cord injury or something like multiple sclerosis, which can also present like this, very similar, and you’re having trouble emptying your bladder, it’s very important to see an urologist and get regular followup to make sure your kidneys are safe.  \n\nAnd lastly, sacral spinal cord injuries, these often present with bladders that actually don’t contract at all. So these bladders essentially don’t work at all. They’re just expanding so and expand like a balloon and they never contract.  \n\nSo you can’t actually empty the urine very well. Sometimes, people who have this problem, particularly, actually diabetics, often can develop this problem after many, many years of having diabetes, can overcome it because they can bear down just like you’re having a bowel movement or having a poop when you push, you can sometimes empty urine that way. \n\nBut these people can also have a sphincter that doesn’t work. So now they have a bunch of urine and a sphincter that doesn’t relax, that’s fixed, and then you’re having trouble emptying your bladder.  \n\nAnd again, these people need to see an urologist regularly to get checked because again, you can have that same problem where the urine fills and fills and fills backs up to the ureters and causes problems with the kidney.  \n\nAlso, many people who have these issues can also get recurrent urinary tract infections. If you want to learn more about how to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections, check out my article on that as well. But this is a real problem and a huge quality of life issue. \n\nIs it okay to have a neurogenic bladder?\n\nAll this to say is that depending on what you have, you may or may not follow the textbook. But certainly these can have serious implications for your bladder function.  \n\nAnd it’s really important to see an urologist to discuss what type of neurogenic bladder you might have and how you can fix it and live a better quality of life, prevent infection and prevent problems to your kidneys.  \n","tags":["bladder"],"readTime":5,"dataSources":null,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":39,"attributes":{"title":"A Urologist explains what edging is and whether it is SAFE!","slug":"a-urologist-explains-what-edging-is-and-whether-it-is-safe","createdAt":"2023-02-25T23:23:44.765Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-26T18:28:17.215Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-25T23:23:47.239Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/4009368/pexels-photo-4009368.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Edging is described as orgasm control or trying to essentially get to the point of climax and then preventing orgasm to delay the active orgasm. This can be done by yourself or with a partner and can be incorporated in many different kinds of sex, including oral, anal or penetrative intercourse.  \n\nSo why do people do Edging, and what are the benefits? \n\nWell, number one is to potentially increase pleasure. So the thought of doing Edging is that as you delay orgasm, it builds up the tension and allows a bigger release when orgasm essentially does occur, causing increased pleasure.  \n\nNumber two, it can offer a way to kind of enhance your connection with your partner, if you’re doing it with a partner. \n\nIt allows you to kind of explore together and potentially even time your orgasms to occur at the same time, which may bring joy to a partner and allow for increased intimacy.  \n\nNumber three, it can be a learning process. \n\nSo using Edging can allow you to really see what sort of stimuli are very pleasurable versus what are less pleasurable and allow you to understand your body better and really obtain more information about what causes you to reach orgasm and what you can do to help prevent it.  \n\nNext, it can allow you greater control. \n\nSo some people really want to have control over how long they can delay orgasm by allowing for a longer period of intercourse and potentially more pleasure for both themselves and their partner, as I described earlier.  \n\nAnd lastly, we often prescribe something similar to this for men with premature ejaculation. \n\nI’ve written several articles on premature ejaculation, so make sure you check those out. But essentially, premature ejaculation is ejaculating before you or your partner wants to causing distress and this usually happens within the first two minutes of intercourse.  \n\nSo the stop start method is essential when you feel that you’re about to achieve climax, you stop for 30 seconds and then you resume. Sometimes you can also add a squeeze where the partner squeezes the glands or head of the penis to help kind of prevent reaching orgasm, and then you go back to it.  ","tags":["Edging"],"readTime":8,"dataSources":null,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":40,"attributes":{"title":" A Urologist's Comprehensive Guide to Genital Piercing and  history of genital Piercing","slug":"a-urologists-comprehensive-guide-to-genital-piercing-and-history-of-genital-piercing","createdAt":"2023-02-26T01:06:26.010Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-26T01:18:53.726Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-26T01:06:30.626Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/6156961/pexels-photo-6156961.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Genital piercing is a form of body piercing that involves piercing a part of the genitalia, thus creating a suitable place for wearing different types of jewellery.

You’ll also see what we call vasocongestion and that’s because there’s increased blood flow to the genitals, specifically to the clitoris.  \n\nThe clitoris itself enlarges, the vagina elongates and widens and the uterus moves up and out of the way. \n\nThe vaginal walls begin to create lubrication and the labia minora actually thin to allow more space for the potential salas later on.  \n\nAnd the labia menora becomes dark and colored. Up to a half to three-fourths of women develop what we call the sex flush. That’s where you can see pinkish spots kind of developing all over the breast, the torso, the hands, the face and even the soles of the feet, the vaginal muscles and even the sphincter of the anus can begin to tighten and contract.  \n\nAnd this phase can last anywhere from several minutes to several hours. \n\nPlateau Phase\n\nThe next phase is the plateau phase, and this is right before you’re about to reach climax or orgasm. And it basically continues everything that’s occurring during the excitement phase.  \n\nBut the clitoris starts to become a little bit sensitive, and it actually withdraws underneath the clitoral hood. If you want a review about all the female anatomy I’m talking about, make sure you check out my article about female anatomy and if the G-⁠spot is real to learn and get a refresher.  \n\nThe glands of the vestibular, the outer part of the vagina, start to make more lubrication. The outer part of the vagina actually swells, and the pelvic floor muscles start to tighten. And this concludes with an orgasm.  \n\nDuring climax, you will see significant increases in heart rate, blood pressure, the pupils will dilate and sometimes you could even have involuntary vocalization. \n\n And fascinatingly, several studies have found that the pain threshold during climax decreases.  \n\nThe vagina and vulva itself also have some interesting changes. And the most pathonemonic finding is pelvic floor contractions occurring at approximately 0.8 sec intervals. And they can be anywhere from 3 to 15 sets of contractions and they can get periodically longer.  \n\nAnd interestingly, orgasms can last anywhere from a few seconds to up to 60 seconds. \n\nThis can also be correlated with other areas of the body contract, including the uterus as well as the rectal fincter.  \n\nAs many of you probably already know, reaching orgasm can be quite a euphoric state and some even describe it as the ultimate meditative state because you cannot, literally cannot, think of anything else.  \n\nResolution Phase\n\nAnd the last phase is the resolution phase. \n\n And during this time, blood pressure drops, your muscles relax and allows your body to kind of slow down from the excited state. And some women may experience a refractory period.  \n\nI’ve talked about this before in my article about multiple orgasms, so you can read that. \n\n But some women can easily have multiple orgasms or others will experience a refractory period, at which point they cannot again achieve climax.  \n\nAnd for some of those women, their clitters can become very sensitive. So it’s important to communicate with your partner if that partner happens to be a female, so that you can be sure to stop submitting them if they are very sensitive.  \n\nAll right, guys, I hope you enjoyed that very much. As always, take care of yourself. ","tags":["orgasm"],"readTime":4,"dataSources":null,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":45,"attributes":{"title":"What your body goes through when you have an erection (it's interesting!)","slug":"what-your-body-goes-through-when-you-have-an-erection-it-s-interesting","createdAt":"2023-03-01T21:34:53.983Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-01T21:46:17.750Z","publishedAt":"2023-03-01T21:34:56.317Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3773668/pexels-photo-3773668.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Although many erections are caused by sexual arousal, such as watching a sexy television show or fantasising, many erections appear to happen for no apparent reason.\n\nSo, if you had an erection in an unusual or embarrassing situation, such as the middle of a really boring history lesson, there's no need to worry.","tags":["erection"],"readTime":5,"dataSources":["https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ca.22655","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8109295/"],"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":46,"attributes":{"title":"Can sexual kinks and fetishes be harmful to your health, according to a urologist?","slug":"can-sexual-kinks-and-fetishes-be-harmful-to-your-health-according-to-a-urologist","createdAt":"2023-03-02T21:52:33.301Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-02T21:52:34.857Z","publishedAt":"2023-03-02T21:52:34.853Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/5915429/pexels-photo-5915429.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"BDSM relates to activities that occur between two or more individuals, that include things like administering or receiving intense sorts of stimuli, which may include pain. \n\nAlso including things like authority and submission in between the two individuals and also including arousal that’s associated with certain inanimate objects or maybe even specific body parts.  \n\nSometimes these activities can also include role play, and it’s described as changing your consciousness or changing your headspace. \n\nSo there’s been a couple studies in areas like Quebec, Belgium and Australia looking at how many people have been interested in kinks like this or have participated in them and how often do they do them regularly.  \n\nAnd depending on the study, at least half of both men and women have either wanted to participate in a sort of fetishes or BDSM like play.

In the meantime, another group was asked to do only Kegel exercises.\nThey found that the women who orgasmed had stronger pelvic floor muscles and better sex lives than those who just did Kegels.\nThe pelvic floor hurts during pregnancy because it has to stretch to make room for the growing baby. Over time, the extra weight makes the muscles weaker, leading to urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and less sexual satisfaction for many women.\nTo help avoid this, new mothers are often told to do exercises that strengthen the muscles on the floor of their pelvis. But if women started sexually induced orgasms and Kegel exercises soon after giving birth, it could improve their quality of life.\nLet me make one thing clear: There's nothing wrong with you or your body if you don't have orgasms from sex alone (or simply have trouble with it).\nBut here's the good news: It's not impossible. And you're on the right track—experimenting with your body during solo sessions, doubling up on foreplay, and pulling in some extra help from toys are all great steps, and all things I recommend to everyone. It certainly helps to have a partner who's more than willing to put in the effort too!\n","tags":["Kegel exercices"],"readTime":3,"dataSources":null,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":53,"attributes":{"title":"How using a vibrator can significantly improve your sexual life","slug":"how-using-a-vibrator-can-significantly-improve-your-sexual-life","createdAt":"2023-03-20T20:43:04.962Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-20T20:43:06.768Z","publishedAt":"2023-03-20T20:43:06.765Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/5187378/pexels-photo-5187378.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Are you interested in using a vibrator?

While there are many tests and indicators used to predict heart disease risk, one of the most surprising indicators is the appearance of your earlobe.\n\nAccording to recent research, a crease in the bottom of your earlobe that starts from the hole and runs at a 45-degree angle could be an indicator of heart disease. In fact, this crease is found in about 71% of people with coronary artery disease.\n\nThe reason for this is that the earlobe is part of the peripheral body, and a lack of blood flow to the tiny capillaries in this area can lead to the loss of elastin, connective tissue, and cartilage, causing it to wrinkle and form the crease.\n\nWhen blood flow to the heart is obstructed, the body can lose collateral circulation, which are extra arteries that serve as a plan B for blood supply to the heart muscle. This chronic lack of blood flow can lead to a loss of circulation in the peripheral parts of the body, including the earlobe, and can cause the crease to appear.\n\nWhile a crease in the earlobe is not a definitive sign of heart disease, it is worth paying attention to, especially since the first symptom of a heart attack in over 50% of cases is death. Early detection of heart disease is crucial, and the presence of the earlobe crease could be a clue that something is not right.\n\nSo, what can you do if you have a crease in your earlobe? \n\nThere are several steps you can take to reduce your risk of heart disease and improve your heart health.\n\nAdopt a Healthy Diet\n\nThe first step is to adopt a healthy diet, specifically the healthy version of the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting. This type of diet has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of heart disease, as well as improving other health markers like blood sugar control and weight loss.\n\nExercise Regularly\n\nExercise is also crucial for heart health, and a regular exercise routine can help flood the body with more oxygen, including the heart muscle. Consistency is key, and it’s important to maintain an exercise routine for the rest of your life.\n\nTake Vitamin E and Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n\nTaking supplements like tocotrienols, a type of vitamin E, and cod liver oil, a source of omega-3 fatty acids, can also be beneficial for heart health. Tocotrienols are a potent antioxidant that can drive oxygen to the heart muscle and protect the vascular system, while cod liver oil contains vitamin A and D, which are important for heart health.\n\nTake Vitamin K2\n\nLastly, taking vitamin K2 with vitamin D3 can help keep calcium from building up in the arteries, reducing the risk of heart disease.\n\nIn conclusion, while a crease in the earlobe is not a definitive sign of heart disease, it can serve as an important indicator to pay attention to. By adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and taking supplements like tocotrienols, cod liver oil, and vitamin K2 with vitamin D3, you can reduce your risk of heart disease and improve your overall heart health. Remember, prevention is key, and early detection can save lives.","tags":["heart attack"],"readTime":4,"dataSources":["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5338988/","https://academic.oup.com/omcr/article/2021/9/omab089/6372553?login=false"],"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":79,"attributes":{"title":"The Hidden Dangers of Diabetes: Understanding the Complications and How to Prevent Them","slug":"the-hidden-dangers-of-diabetes-understanding-the-complications-and-how-to-prevent-them","createdAt":"2023-03-30T19:34:32.425Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-30T19:41:36.411Z","publishedAt":"2023-03-30T19:41:36.410Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1001897/pexels-photo-1001897.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects millions of people around the world.
