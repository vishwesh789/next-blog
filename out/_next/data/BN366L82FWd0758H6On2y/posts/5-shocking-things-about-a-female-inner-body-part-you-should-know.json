And as they differentiate into a female and a male fetus, they then develop a clitoris or a penis.  \n\nAnd they both have the exact same structures. Essentially, they have corporate cavernosa which fills and expands with blood when aroused and they extend in size. In fact, for a long time, people thought that the clitoris had about 8000 neurofibers. \n\nA recent study published out of the Oregon Health Sciences University, looking at clitoral tissue under microscopes found that it has an average of 10,000 neurons in the clitoris, meaning is it highly sensitive and probably the only organ that’s ever been identified that’s made purely for pleasure purposes.  \n\nThe clitoris has a foreskin. \n\nThis is called the clitoral hood or prep use, and it’s actually there to protect the clitoris from infection or irritation. It’s very similar to the foreskin of the penis.  \n\nIn fact, sometimes that prep use or clitoral hood can develop inflammation from oil, build up or dead skin cells and cause pain, discomfort or even adhesions between the clitoris itself and the hood.  \n\nThis is kind of similar to what we’d call smegma in men, which can be uncomfortable and make erections and pleasure sometimes difficult. In women, this can sometimes have no symptoms at all. Or other times it can be painful around the clitoris or when someone touches the clitoris or it can make it more difficult to achieve orgasm.  \n\nIn patients who have these problems, there is an in office-based procedure called clitoral adhesiolysis that can be done to free the glands of the clitoris from the hood itself. And while this is not a highly studied area, in a study of 41 women, the responses after this procedure were actually quite good. \n\n76% reported improvement in pain. 63% reported improvement in sexual arousal. Overall, the large majority were really satisfied with sex after the procedure and with their decision to have the procedure.  \n\nThe Labia minora, or the inner lips of the vagina, can vary from person to person. \n\n The labia minora are kind of like a fingerprint. They come in all different shapes, colors, sizes, thicknesses, and they’re unique to you, just like your fingerprint.  \n\nNot everyone looks alike. In fact, many of the images you see in pornography are digitally mastered to make them look a certain way. Many women can have labor labia minora that protrude outside the outer lips or can even be asymmetrical. So they have one that’s longer, or they have more on one side than the other. \n\nInterestingly, during arousal, the labia minora can grow up to two to three times larger than usual. And they can also change color.  \n\nThey usually change from a pinkish color to an intense red color right before orgasm. And the good news is, all these changes are just temporary. After sex, these things go completely back to normal. \n\nThe vagina increases in width and length when preparing for sex. \n\nThe walls of the vagina send signals to the brain telling it, hey, we’re ready. And a couple of things happen. Your body starts producing lubrication in the vagina, and also the vagina increases in width and length.  \n\nIn the non-aroused state, the vagina is about 3 to 4 cm wide and 8 to 9 cm in length. However, this can increase in up to twice its size to be ready to accommodate an erect penis. And after sex, it all goes back to normal.  \n\nSo there is no such thing as getting a loose vagina from having sex. Your body is extremely adaptable and malleable. \n\nThe vagina is self-cleaning and has its own bacteria. \n\nThe vaginal environment is very protective.  \n\nIn fact, because of the estrogen in the vagina, the vagina typically creates an acidic environment. It also has very special bacteria that help protect the vagina’s microbiome. This helps prevent infection and prevent any bad bacteria from entering the vagina.  \n\nIf you’re suffering from recurrent yeast infection, infections or bacterial infections, or even recurrent urinary tract infections, it’s typically a sign there’s something abnormal in the microbiome.  \n\nIn fact, a very easy treatment for prevention of recurrent UTIs is using vaginal estrogen. Particularly in women who no longer make enough estrogen, like those who are postmenopausal, have had surgery or on medications that reduce their estrogen. \n\nIt’s really important not to clean inside the vagina. Your vagina does it itself, so things like douching are really not recommended. And if you want to clean down there, you want to take soapy water and let it run down the outside and only clean the hair-bearing areas, the vagina will take care of itself.  \n\nIt doesn’t need to smell like flowers or roses or vanilla or candy or anything like that. It has its own smell, and it is perfect just the way it is. \n\nAll right, guys, I hope you all found this very helpful, as always, when we take care of yourself. ","tags":["vagina"],"readTime":4,"dataSources":["https://academic.oup.com/jsm/article/19/9/1412/6961320?login=false","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ca.22177","https://issmsmsna2022.org/program/program/?persons=4928&q"],"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}},"body":{"id":35,"content":"<h2 data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">Did you know that the clitoris is literally exactly like the penis in men?</h2><h2 data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">&nbsp;</h2><p>Today we’re going to be talking about five things I bet you didn’t know about female genitalia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>So the first thing I bet you didn’t know is that the clitoris is like the penis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, they are homologs, which means embryologically&nbsp;the clitoris, and the penis were the exact same thing in the fetus.
