This hormone causes the pituitary, another part of the brain, to release Luteinizing Harmone&nbsp;(LH).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LH sends signals to the latest cells of the testicles, producing testosterone thereafter. Then, testosterone goes to specific cells around the body, including the muscle. Then the testosterone goes inside the cells and binds to an androgen receptor.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The binding of the testosterone and the androgen receptor then causes a cascade of gene production, which then goes on to make proteins and building blocks for your body.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How does exercise actually lead to increases in serum testosterone?&nbsp;</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, when you exercise, there is a release of both catabolic and anabolic hormones. That means hormones that break you down and grow you up. One of these hormones includes testosterone. This increase in testosterone also up-regulates the expression of the androgen receptor and subsequently causes increases in protein synthesis.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And the theory is that after exercise, your testosterone goes way up. This increases the half-life of the androgen receptor Messenger Ribonucleic acid (MRNA), which is the gene product of the androgen receptor, and increases it’s half-life.&nbsp;So this makes it more likely that you’re going to have hypertrophic adaptation or essentially muscle growth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But it’s important to note that there appears to be a threshold of metabolic demand or volume of work&nbsp;that you need to achieve to actually get the testosterone boost.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Workout to increase testosterone</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So let’s get into it. We’re going to talk about the intensity of the workout, the number of sets and repetitions, the order of the workout, as well as the amount of rusting period you should have.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So let’s start with resistance training.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resistance training has been studied and specifically I use these terms so you’ll understand them. Intensity describes the difficulty of the exercise and it’s typically based on the amount of weight that you lift.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A repetition maximum is the maximum amount of weight you can lift for a defined number of movements and volume of work, which I said is the key marker for testosterone&nbsp;boosting includes the number of sets, the repetitions and the intensity of the work.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So let me give you an example, for increasing intensity,&nbsp;if you did 5&nbsp;reps of something with 100 pounds, and you did then 5&nbsp;reps with 150 pounds, you have then increased the intensity. But if you went from 5&nbsp;reps of 100 pounds to 10&nbsp;reps of 100 pounds, you increase the volume.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the testosterone studies looking at what types of exercise actually boost testosterone, there have been two kind of bigger studies that have come out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once, they looked at 3&nbsp;to 5&nbsp;repetitions of 3&nbsp;lower body exercises at 100% of 6&nbsp;reps maximum.&nbsp;So meaning you’re maxing your weight capacity and doing 6&nbsp;repetitions 3&nbsp;times of each of the three exercises.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The other study looked at 5&nbsp;sets of 10&nbsp;repetitions of 10&nbsp;repetition maximums. So not focusing on the numbers I just gave you, but the thing to realize is that you need to be using your 100% repetition maximum, so you want to take the heaviest weight that you can to do the entire set.&nbsp;</p><h2>What about endurance training?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So endurance training does increase testosterone in the short term. So when doing very short durations or two to five minutes of 90% to 100% VO2 max, which is kind of the&nbsp;maximum amount of oxygen your body can use during an exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Usually, in order to find out your VO2&nbsp;max, you’ll either get a stress test at your doctor’s office or you go to an exercise medicine sort of clinic where they can measure that for you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So in endurance exercise specifically, you will often see an initial increase in testosterone.&nbsp;But later, because of the stress of the aerobic exercise, your body starts releasing cortisol, and Cortisol then inhibits testosterone production, which causes a decline in the testosterone. Particularly in high elite endurance athletes, you’ll find that they may actually have lower testosterone levels.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is because the high endurance athlete creates what’s called reactive oxygen species in response to stress. These reactive oxygen species can actually blunt the pathway in the brain that tells the testicles to make more testosterone.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>So when you’re comparing, should I do resistance training or should I do endurance training to increase testosterone?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally, resistance training is going to be the one thing that boosts your testosterone the most. There also have been some small studies which have looked at high intensity interval training that do show improvements in testosterone levels after performing high-intensity interval training.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, looking at the data, a lot of the data says the testosterone boosts only for an hour or a short period of time after the exercise. Some studies have shown improvements in testosterone as long as 48 hours after the exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But it’s important to realize that doing one time resistance training is not going to boost your testosterone levels&nbsp;for a prolonged period of time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What about the number of sets and repetitions?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, as I mentioned before, the volume of work is what matters the most.&nbsp;So you can modify the numbers of sets and the numbers of repetitions as long as you keep the intensity high and you can get the same amount of volume of work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What about training to failure?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, one study actually looked at this.&nbsp;They essentially found followed 40 men, and they divided them up into three groups. One that exercised to failure, meaning they worked out until they could not lift anything anymore. The others exercised not to failure, and the last group didn’t exercise at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What they found was that those who did not go to failure had greater gains when doing lower extremity exercise in muscular power output, whereas those who went to failure had larger gains in the number of repetitions they could do with the bench press.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>But what about their testosterone?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They found that the group that didn’t go to failure had lower cortisol concentrations, meaning they had less stress in their body and had higher testosterone levels.&nbsp;So going to failure may not be the best thing for your testosterone level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>All right, so we said resistance exercises are the best, but what kind of resistance exercises?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, as we mentioned before, you want high intensity, but you also want to use large muscle groups.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So even if you do a high intensity small muscle math, it’s not going to boost your testosterone. For example, a jump squat, which is using your lower extremities in your core, is going to have a higher testosterone increase than those who are getting the bench press.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also, things like squats and Olympic lifts can actually produce a higher increase in testosterone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What about using free weights vs machine?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When they looked at this, free weights actually increased plasma testosterone levels more than those who had machine weights.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The reason for this is likely because when you’re using free weights, you’re also using other muscle bodies like your core to help stabilize, whereas with machines, they really try to isolate the muscle that you’re exercising with.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What about resting periods? How long of a rest should you take?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, in a study looking at intensity, number of sets and repetitions, as well as resting time, what they found was that moderate intensity, higher volume, and shorter resting times actually had a higher increase in plasma testosterone.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So using a shorter rest period, in this case using 60 seconds versus 90 seconds, led to better improvements in total testosterone levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>So if you’re going to do both resistance and endurance training, what goes first?&nbsp;</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, based on the hormone physiology you want to use, as we mentioned before, large muscle groups, and you want to be able to have that elevated testosterone level throughout your entire workout. So the best bet for having a greater boost and prolonged boost in testosterone is to start with the resistance training&nbsp;using the large muscle mass followed by the endurance training.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What about changes in the basal testosterone level? That means you’re resting testosterone level when you’re not exercising. Does doing resistance training actually impact that level?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, for now, we’re not exactly sure. While we’ve seen that continued bouts of exercise, particularly in one study where they looked at three different bouts of exercise, they persistently saw increases in total testosterone after each of the bouts of exercise.&nbsp;So we know that the resistance training does improve testosterone level, even when done repeatedly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If you’re exercising regularly, regardless of the type or intensity of the exercise, it does not seem to have a lasting effect on the basal testosterone level.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, we do see some small studies, particularly in obese individuals and older patients, where we do see an increase in basal testosterone levels. The theory for this, for at least the overweight and obese individuals, is that they’re also losing weight.&nbsp;So they’re losing weight circumference, as well as fat loss, which can also boost testosterone levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So if you want to see the continued testosterone boost, you got to keep doing the resistance training.&nbsp;That’s why you never skip leg day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>All right, so what if you’re doing all the right things? You’ve been doing all the right exercises, but you’re still struggling.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Why is my testosterone not increasing?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, there are a couple of factors that make it more difficult to boost a testosterone response.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The first one is obesity.</strong> Obesity can cause endothelial dysfunction as well as vasodilation of the blood vessels. What that means is that blood vessels are not as good at carrying blood to and from the testicles.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This can then make it more difficult for them to respond. It does seem that they do boost their testosterone, but it may not be as high of a boost as someone who is leaner in weight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The second thing is age.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So men’s ability to produce testosterone peaks at about age 40. After that, it tends to decline about 1% to 3% per year over the course of the lifetime. And this is just like any other part of your body.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The cells in the testicle, called the LATIC cells, have less of a response because they’ve gotten older to the stimulation produced by the brain or the pituitary. So older men, still similar to obese men, still mount a response, but usually it’s less of a response than younger men.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But the bottom line I want you to take away from this article&nbsp;is regardless of your age, any other conditions, you have your weight. There is sufficient evidence that doing resistance exercises with large muscle mass,&nbsp;using moderate to high intensity with short resting periods and high volume, can produce increases in testosterone level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, right after you’re done reading&nbsp;this article, get up and do some jump squats.&nbsp;You can do them right at home. You don’t need a fancy gym. And start getting that boost of testosterone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
