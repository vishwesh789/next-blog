It is money that you can earn without dedicating your time to it continuously. Passive income streams could be in the form of rental income, investing in stocks, bonds, or even high-interest rate savings accounts. <strong>In this article, we’ll focus on high-interest rate savings accounts, which are one of the easiest ways to earn passive income.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>High-interest rate savings accounts are simple to set up, and the returns are almost guaranteed. In this article, we’ll dive into what high-interest rate savings accounts are, why you should use them, which ones are best for you, and how you can maximize your returns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What Are High-Interest Rate Savings Accounts?</h2><p>High-interest rate savings accounts are like regular savings accounts, but with a higher interest rate. The interest rate is the percentage of the balance in your savings account that you’ll earn over a set period. In most cases, high-interest rate savings accounts are offered by online banks or credit unions that can offer better interest rates than traditional brick-and-mortar banks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why Should You Use High-Interest Rate Savings Accounts?</p><p>There are several reasons why you should use high-interest rate savings accounts. Firstly, they’re risk-free. Your money is protected up to £85,000 by the Financial Conduct Authority if you use a bank or account that’s regulated by them. Secondly, the interest you earn up to a certain amount is tax-free. If you’re a base-rate taxpayer earning up to £50,000, the interest you earn up to £1,000 is tax-free, and for higher-rate taxpayers earning between £50,000 and £150,000, the interest you earn up to £500 is tax-free. Finally, high-interest rate savings accounts offset the impact of inflation. Inflation is currently around the 2.5% mark, which means that stuff costs 2% more than it did the year before. If you put your money into a traditional savings account at 0.1% interest, you’re losing out to inflation. However, with high-interest rate savings accounts, you’re offsetting the amount your money is losing out to inflation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Which High-Interest Rate Savings Account Is Best for You?</h2><p>There are four types of high-interest rate savings accounts: easy access savings accounts, notice savings accounts, fixed-rate savings accounts, and cash ISAs. The best one for you depends on your situation. Easy access savings accounts are useful if you’re saving for something in the short term, such as a holiday or a big present. They’re currently paying around the 0.6% mark, and you’ll be paid monthly rather than annually. Notice savings accounts require you to give the banking provider advanced notice before withdrawing your money, usually around 30 days. In return, you’ll be rewarded with higher interest rates of around 1.1% currently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fixed-rate savings accounts are useful if you have a big purchase coming up, such as buying a house, a car, or saving up for a wedding. They’re currently paying around the 2% mark and make sense to use until you need to access that money. Finally, cash ISAs are useful if you’re looking to save for the long run. They can be fixed-rate or easy access savings accounts, and they’re currently paying around the 1.5% mark. It makes sense to put some of your emergency funds and the next three to six months of expenses into an easy access savings account, which you can tap into at any time, and put some of your cash into a fixed-rate option where you can lock in those higher rates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How Can You Maximize Your Returns?</h2><p>To maximize your returns, you need to make sure that you’re not paying any fees on your savings account. Some providers may charge monthly or annual fees, and these can eat into your interest earnings. So make sure to read the terms and conditions carefully before opening an account and make sure there are no hidden fees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another thing to consider is whether the interest rate is fixed or variable. Fixed rate accounts offer a guaranteed rate of interest for a set period of time, while variable rate accounts can change at any time. If you choose a fixed rate account, make sure you’re comfortable with the length of the fixed term, as you may not be able to access your money during this time without penalty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, consider the provider’s reputation and customer service. Look for a provider that is well-established and has a good track record for customer service. You want to make sure that your money is in safe hands and that you can easily get help if you have any issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So which high interest rate savings accounts should you consider? There are many providers out there, so it’s important to do your research and compare rates and terms. <strong>Here are some of the top providers in the UK at the time of writing:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Marcus by Goldman Sachs</strong> - currently offering 0.4% variable interest rate with no fees and no minimum deposit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>NS&amp;I Income Bonds</strong> - currently offering 0.16% variable interest rate with no fees, but a minimum deposit of £500.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Ford Money</strong> - currently offering 0.4% variable interest rate with no fees and a minimum deposit of £1.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Virgin Money</strong> - currently offering 0.35% variable interest rate with no fees and a minimum deposit of £1.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Remember, the interest rates mentioned here are subject to change, so make sure to check the provider’s website for the most up-to-date information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In conclusion,</strong> high interest rate savings accounts are a great way to earn passive income with minimal effort. They’re safe, tax-efficient, and can help you offset the impact of inflation. To choose the best account for you, consider the interest rate, fees, fixed vs variable rate, and provider reputation. And most importantly, make sure to read the terms and conditions carefully before opening an account.</p>"}}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
