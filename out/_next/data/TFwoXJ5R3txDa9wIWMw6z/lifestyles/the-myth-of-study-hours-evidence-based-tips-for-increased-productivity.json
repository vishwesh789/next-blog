This might sound like a shock, but 49 studies have proven that there’s only a weak relationship between the two. So, what’s the secret to success, you ask? It’s all about productivity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>In this article, we’ll discuss evidence-based tips that you can use to increase your productivity and achieve your goals faster.</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 1: Keep Yourself Busy</strong></p><p>The first tip is to keep yourself busy. It may seem counterintuitive, but it’s true. When you have a lot on your plate, you’re less likely to be distracted by random things around you. In today’s digital age, there are countless distractions that can keep you from being productive, such as social media, YouTube, and online shopping. By keeping yourself busy with productive tasks, you’ll have less time for distractions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The key is to find hobbies or activities that complement your work. For example, if you’re a programmer, you can join a filmmaking group or a development group to keep your mind busy. This way, when you hit a creative block in one area, you can switch to another and come back to it later. Over time, you’ll find that you’re more productive and better at multiple tasks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 2: Reward Yourself</strong></p><p>The second tip is to reward yourself. It’s important to take breaks and recharge your batteries from time to time. When you overwork yourself for extended periods, you’re more likely to burn out and become less productive. So, take short breaks and reward yourself with something you enjoy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if you’ve been working hard for a month, you can take a two-day break to do something you love, like traveling or spending time with family and friends. When you come back to work, you’ll be rejuvenated and ready to tackle new challenges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 3: Plan Your Time</strong></p><p>The third tip is to plan your time. It’s essential to set goals and prioritize your tasks. Without a plan, it’s easy to get distracted and lose focus. One way to plan your time is to use the Pomodoro Technique. This technique involves working for 25 minutes and then taking a five-minute break. After four cycles, take a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes. This technique helps you to stay focused and avoid burnout.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 4: Eliminate Distractions</strong></p><p>The fourth tip is to eliminate distractions. In today’s digital age, it’s easy to get distracted by notifications, emails, and social media. To avoid distractions, turn off notifications, close unnecessary tabs, and use apps like Freedom or RescueTime to block distracting websites.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 5: Take Care of Your Health</strong></p><p>The fifth tip is to take care of your health. Your physical and mental health is essential for productivity. Make sure you get enough sleep, exercise regularly, and eat a healthy diet. Taking care of your health helps you to stay energized, focused, and productive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 6: Learn to Say No</strong></p><p>The sixth tip is to learn to say no. It’s essential to prioritize your time and focus on tasks that are important. If you’re constantly saying yes to everything, you’ll end up overworking yourself and losing focus. Learn to say no to tasks that don’t align with your goals and priorities.</p><p>Step 7: Track Your Progress</p><p>The next step to being more productive is to track your progress. Keeping a record of what you have accomplished can be a great motivation booster. When you see how far you have come, you will be motivated to keep going. It’s important to keep a record of both your short-term and long-term goals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In college, I used to maintain a checklist of all the topics that I had to cover for my exams. Every time I completed a topic, I would check it off the list. This helped me stay motivated and on track. It also gave me a sense of accomplishment every time I checked off an item from my list.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, as a software developer, I use a similar approach. I maintain a to-do list of all the tasks that I need to complete. I use a task management tool like Trello or Asana to keep track of my tasks. Every time I complete a task, I move it to the “done” list. This helps me keep track of my progress and stay motivated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 8: Take Regular Breaks</strong></p><p>Taking regular breaks is important for staying productive. It’s important to take short breaks throughout the day to give your brain a rest. This will help you stay focused and alert throughout the day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In college, I used to take short breaks every hour or so. During these breaks, I would go for a walk or do some stretching exercises. This helped me stay focused and alert throughout the day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, as a software developer, I take short breaks every hour or so.

It’s important to keep your workspace organized and clutter-free. This will help you stay focused and avoid distractions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In college, I used to keep my desk organized and clutter-free. I would only keep the books and notes that I needed for studying on my desk. This helped me stay focused and avoid distractions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, as a software developer, I keep my workspace organized and clutter-free. I only keep the tools and materials that I need for my work on my desk. This helps me stay focused and avoid distractions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 10: Get Enough Sleep</strong></p><p>Getting enough sleep is important for staying productive. It’s important to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep every night. This will help you stay focused and alert throughout the day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In college, I used to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep every night.

This helps me stay focused and productive throughout the day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In conclusion,</strong> being productive is not just about working harder or longer. It’s about working smarter. By following these evidence-based steps, you can make yourself more productive and churn out more in less number of hours.</p>"}}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
