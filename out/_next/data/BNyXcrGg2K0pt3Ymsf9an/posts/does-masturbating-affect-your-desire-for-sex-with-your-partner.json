However, in other cases, masturbation can increase sexual desire and arousal, which can lead to an increased desire for sex with a partner.\n\nIt's important to note that masturbation is a normal and healthy form of sexual expression, and it doesn't necessarily have to impact one's desire for partnered sex. Open and honest communication with one's partner about sexual desires and needs can help address any potential issues related to masturbation and partnered sex.","tags":["masturbation"],"readTime":4,"dataSources":["https://academic.oup.com/jsm/article-abstract/17/1/37/6973550?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false"],"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}},"body":{"id":56,"content":"<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Nearly everyone masturbates, but I get asked all the time, will a sex toy replace me? Will my partner still be able to climax with me if they’re using a sex toy?&nbsp;</p><p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">&nbsp;</p><h2>Is a sex toy good or bad for your sex life?&nbsp;</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Female Masturbation</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I’m going to explain everything you need to know about female masturbation and how it affects their sex lives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the US, 80% of women between the ages of 18 and 40 report masturbating at some point in the last year.&nbsp;When you break it up by age group, women between the ages of 18 and 24 in the last year, about 46% of them admit to masturbating in the last year. Between 25 and 29, about 77%. And between 30 and 49, about 46% admit to masturbating in the last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You may be wondering, do women masturbate because it’s better than sex, or is there other reasons?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And in fact, when you look at the data on women who do masturbate, the reason they use masturbation, or the way they perceive it as a distinctly different experience than partnered sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most often it’s because women want to have physical pleasure, stress, anxiety reduction, or they might be having issues with their partner, whereas they view partnered sex as a time for mutual enjoyment, closeness, bonding and a way to please their partner or for their partner’s enjoyment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A group of researchers sought to identify if women who participated in masturbation had orgasmic&nbsp;difficulties with masturbation, with partnered sex, and if there was a link with either of those activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So they surveyed about 2200 women and they asked them questions about how often they masturbated, if they had issues during masturbation, what specific types of activities they did during that time, and if they also did those activities during partnered sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So they asked these women what kind of activities they did during masturbation. These most commonly include clitoral stimulation and vaginal stimulation, using some sort of aid like a vibrator, having some sort of specific position, having anal stimulation and using fantasies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And then they looked at how often they used these same things during partnered sex. And over 90% of the women who engage in clitoral or vaginal stimulation incorporated that into partnered sex.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, the use of the other things that they did during masturbation was less common.&nbsp;For example, only about half of women use the same type of body position that they preferred during masturbation and even less&nbsp;about 46% use anal stimulation and about a third used an aid or incorporate their sexual fantasy into partnered sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>So, did women who masturbated more often have difficulty with orgasming or climax?&nbsp;</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the answer was no. Women who had difficulty with orgasming did not actually correlate with women who masturbated more often.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, people who had difficulty orgasming often had difficulty orgasmic with masturbation due to either lack of time, lack of arousal, certain medications, or pain, making it difficult for them to reach climax.&nbsp;All of those make sense.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, women who masturbated more actually had fewer problems with arousal during sex. In fact, those women who aligned those activities that they did during masturbation and they used them in partnered sex had the greatest orgasmic pleasure, had the lowest time to orgasm or lowest orgasmic latency, and had less difficulty getting aroused.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And in fact, the majority of women, 57% preferred having sex with their partner. Only 12% said that they preferred masturbating, 7% that they were both equally satisfying, and a quarter said it depended.&nbsp;Sometimes masturbation was more pleasurable and sometimes&nbsp;partnered sex was more pleasurable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And I’m sure everybody reading&nbsp;this article&nbsp;can agree that sometimes it just isn’t that great in one way or the other for either activity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bottom line from what we can extrapolate from this data to real life, women who masturbate more frequently are less likely to have problems reaching orgasm and fewer problems with arousal. And perhaps greater experience with masturbation expands the woman’s sexual repertoire and actually helps them identify pleasure points and things that really get them around, so they can bring that to partnered sex.&nbsp;And both parties can have mutually enjoyable partnered sex.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So no, you’re not going to get replaced by a toy, and in fact, you might actually have better sex because of it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
