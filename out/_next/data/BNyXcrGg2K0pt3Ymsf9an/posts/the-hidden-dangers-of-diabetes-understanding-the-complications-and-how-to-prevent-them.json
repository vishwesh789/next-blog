It is a metabolic disorder that arises due to the inability of the body to produce enough insulin or the resistance of cells to the effects of insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate the amount of glucose in the blood. In people with diabetes, their blood sugar levels remain consistently high, leading to various complications that can damage different parts of the body.","tags":["Diabetes"],"readTime":4,"dataSources":["https://www.e-pan.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.20463%2Fjenb.2017.0027","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19409449/"],"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}},"body":{"id":101,"content":"<p data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\"><strong>Diabetes</strong> is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. While most people are familiar with the term and know that it involves high blood glucose levels, many do not realize the potential complications that can arise from this condition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>In this article, we will discuss the four key tissues that can be affected by high blood glucose levels, as well as the five essential vitamins that can help prevent and manage these complications.</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Four Tissues Affected by Diabetes</strong></p><p>As mentioned earlier, there are four key tissues that can be affected by high blood glucose levels: the eyes, the vascular system, the nervous system, and the kidneys. Let’s take a closer look at each of these.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>The Eyes</strong></li></ol><p>The eyes are one of the most susceptible organs to diabetes-related complications. High blood glucose levels can damage the retina, which is the main nerve tissue responsible for transmitting visual information to the brain. When the retina is damaged, it can lead to blindness, macular degeneration, cataracts, and glaucoma.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>The Vascular System</strong></li></ol><p>The endothelial layer inside the arteries is highly susceptible to high blood glucose levels. When there is a build-up of plaque and clots, it can obstruct blood flow to the heart muscle or the brain. High blood glucose levels flowing through the arteries in the brain can lead to degenerative brain problems such as dementia, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s. The nervous system in the rest of the body can also be affected, leading to peripheral neuropathy, which causes numbness, tingling, or burning in the hands, feet, or fingertips.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>The Nervous System</strong></li></ol><p>The nervous system is responsible for transmitting messages between the brain and the rest of the body. High blood glucose levels can damage the nerves in the body, leading to peripheral neuropathy and other autonomic nervous system-related complications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>The Kidneys</strong></li></ol><p>The kidneys act as filters for the blood, removing waste and excess fluid. High blood glucose levels can damage the kidneys, leading to end-stage renal failure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Understanding Glycation and Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When high blood glucose levels are combined with proteins such as hemoglobin, they create a condition called glycation. This process leads to a combination of sugar and protein that gets stuck and sticky, making the tissue non-functional. Hemoglobin that is damaged by glycation is represented by a number called glycated hemoglobin or HbA1c. This number gives an average of blood sugar levels over a period of three months, making it a better assessment tool for diabetes management.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Glycation</strong> can also occur when we eat foods that combine sugar with protein and heat, such as barbecued ribs, hamburgers, fries, and donuts. When glycation builds up, it forms advanced glycation end products (AGEs). The accumulation of AGEs leads to free radical damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress, which can cause tissue damage and complications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Preventing and Managing Diabetes Complications with Vitamins</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While there are many approaches to managing diabetes, including lifestyle changes and medication, adding specific vitamins to your diet can help prevent and manage complications. Here are five vitamins that can help:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Vitamin D:</strong></p><p>This vitamin plays a role in regulating blood sugar levels and improving insulin sensitivity. Research has shown that people with type 2 diabetes often have low levels of vitamin D. Therefore, taking vitamin D supplements or getting enough sunlight exposure can be beneficial.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Vitamin B12:</strong></p><p>This vitamin is important for nerve health and can help reduce the risk of diabetic neuropathy, a common complication of diabetes. Good sources of vitamin B12 include meat, fish, and dairy products. For those who are deficient, supplements can be helpful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Vitamin C:</strong></p><p>This vitamin is an antioxidant that can help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in the body, which can contribute to complications of diabetes. Good sources of vitamin C include citrus fruits, berries, and leafy green vegetables.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Vitamin E:</strong></p><p>This vitamin is also an antioxidant that can help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in the body. It has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of heart disease, which is a common complication of diabetes. Good sources of vitamin E include nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Magnesium:</strong></p><p>This mineral is important for regulating blood sugar levels and improving insulin sensitivity. Studies have shown that people with diabetes often have low levels of magnesium. Good sources of magnesium include leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. Supplements can also be helpful for those who are deficient.</p></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In addition to nutrient supplementation,</strong> other strategies for preventing or managing diabetes complications include maintaining healthy blood sugar levels through diet and exercise, monitoring blood sugar regularly, and working with a healthcare provider to manage any underlying conditions that may contribute to high blood sugar. With the right tools and support, it is possible to live a healthy and fulfilling life with diabetes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
