When calculating this number, include everything you’d want and need to spend on if you stopped working today. Then, multiply that number by 25, and this number gives you a rough estimate of how much money you should save and invest to be able to retire today. For example, if you calculate all your expenses and spending and that comes to $40,000, then you would need to invest $1 million for your retirement.
