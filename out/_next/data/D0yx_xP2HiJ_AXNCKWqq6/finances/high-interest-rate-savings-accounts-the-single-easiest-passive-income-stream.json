Firstly, they’re risk-free. Your money is protected up to £85,000 by the Financial Conduct Authority if you use a bank or account that’s regulated by them. Secondly, the interest you earn up to a certain amount is tax-free. If you’re a base-rate taxpayer earning up to £50,000, the interest you earn up to £1,000 is tax-free, and for higher-rate taxpayers earning between £50,000 and £150,000, the interest you earn up to £500 is tax-free. Finally, high-interest rate savings accounts offset the impact of inflation. Inflation is currently around the 2.5% mark, which means that stuff costs 2% more than it did the year before. If you put your money into a traditional savings account at 0.1% interest, you’re losing out to inflation. However, with high-interest rate savings accounts, you’re offsetting the amount your money is losing out to inflation.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.h2, {\n      children: \"Which High-Interest Rate Savings Account Is Best for You?\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"There are four types of high-interest rate savings accounts: easy access savings accounts, notice savings accounts, fixed-rate savings accounts, and cash ISAs.

They’re currently paying around the 0.6% mark, and you’ll be paid monthly rather than annually.

They can be fixed-rate or easy access savings accounts, and they’re currently paying around the 1.5% mark.
