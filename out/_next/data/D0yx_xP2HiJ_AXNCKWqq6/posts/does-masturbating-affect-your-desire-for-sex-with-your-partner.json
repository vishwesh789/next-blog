However, in other cases, masturbation can increase sexual desire and arousal, which can lead to an increased desire for sex with a partner.\n\nIt's important to note that masturbation is a normal and healthy form of sexual expression, and it doesn't necessarily have to impact one's desire for partnered sex. Open and honest communication with one's partner about sexual desires and needs can help address any potential issues related to masturbation and partnered sex.","tags":["masturbation"],"slug":"does-masturbating-affect-your-desire-for-sex-with-your-partner","readTime":4,"img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3773665/pexels-photo-3773665.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","dataSources":["https://academic.oup.com/jsm/article-abstract/17/1/37/6973550?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false"],"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
