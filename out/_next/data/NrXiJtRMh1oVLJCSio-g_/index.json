In today's digital age, the majority of home buyers start their search online. This means that the first impression a buyer has of a property is often through the photographs that are posted on the internet.\n\nHigh-quality, professional photos can make a property stand out from the competition, and increase the chances of a potential buyer taking the next step and scheduling a viewing. On the other hand, poor-quality or amateurish photos can turn off potential buyers and make a property seem unappealing.\n\nReal estate photography also plays a role in the pricing of a property. High-quality photos can help showcase the best features of a property and justify a higher asking price. Conversely, poor-quality photos can make a property seem less valuable and lead to lower offers from buyers.","tags":["real estate photography"],"readTime":8,"dataSources":null,"category":{"data":{"id":6,"attributes":{"title":"Career","slug":"career","createdAt":"2023-03-22T21:26:35.063Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-22T21:27:47.418Z","publishedAt":"2023-03-22T21:27:47.416Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/601170/pexels-photo-601170.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":4,"attributes":{"username":"Lynda","email":"lynda@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-03-24T18:26:29.905Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-29T21:46:22.119Z"}}}}},{"id":14,"attributes":{"title":"Behind the scenes of a wedding photographer's day","createdAt":"2023-03-28T23:03:19.340Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-28T23:06:37.070Z","publishedAt":"2023-03-28T23:03:21.449Z","slug":"behind-the-scenes-of-a-wedding-photographer-s-day","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/22185/pexels-photo.jpg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Wedding photography is one of the most challenging and rewarding forms of photography.
