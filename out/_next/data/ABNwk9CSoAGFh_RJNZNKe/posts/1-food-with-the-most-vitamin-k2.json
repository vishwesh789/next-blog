Most of the probiotics end up at the end of your intestinal system, also known as the colon.\n\n The gut microbiome is incredibly important to our health, but we don’t totally understand it just yet. We’ve seen relationships between irregularities in the microbiome and diseases like diabetes, obesity, heart disease, mental conditions like depression, anxiety. The bacteria found within your gut can control your emotions, your depressive, anxiety symptoms, your moods, your appetite even.\n\n There’s seven to 90 different strains of good bacteria inside your gut. Experts deem probiotics to be a safe supplement, yet potential risks exist. The average healthy person should not be taking a daily probiotic. We have not proved it to give enough benefit to warrant the risks and especially spending money on a supplement that may not give you any benefit.","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":6,"dataSources":null}},{"id":7,"attributes":{"title":"Reduce Anxiety & Stress with the Physiological Sigh ","slug":"reduce-anxiety-and-stress-with-the-physiological-sigh","createdAt":"2023-02-02T13:56:39.070Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-04T23:31:30.111Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-02T13:56:41.866Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3094215/pexels-photo-3094215.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Billions of people suffer from stress. And there are tools to combat stress that involve things like meditation, breath work, good nutrition, good social connections, and avoiding all bad things in life. \nAnd while those are powerful, the problem is they require that people step away from the stress inducing activity. My lab and other laboratories have been very interested in developing tools that allow us to push back on stress. \nFeel more calm in real time, meaning without having to disengage from the stress-inducing activity. The best way that I am aware of doing that is called the physiological sigh. A physiological sigh is a pattern of breathing that involves two inhales followed by an extended exhale. \nPhysiological sighs were discovered in the 1930s as a pattern of breathing that people go into spontaneously when they are in claustrophobic environments or in deep sleep. When there's a buildup of a gas called carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, carbon dioxide triggers the impulse to breathe. \nThere are neurons in the brain that know when carbon dioxide levels have gotten too high. And when the levels get too high, they trigger inhale and exhale, or double inhale and exhale. Now, you can do physiological size voluntarily. \nAnytime you're feeling too stressed and you want to feel more calm, you do it like this. So it's a double inhale. And typically the first inhale is longer than the second, but the second one is still important to do, and then a very long extended exhale. \nTypically, both inhales are through the nose and the exhale is through the mouth. That's the most effective way to do the physiological side. However, if you can't breathe through your nose or your mouth, for whatever reason, do it throughout your mouth or throughout your nose. \nThe second inhale is really important because your lungs are not just two big bags of air. They're two big bags of air with lots of little sacks, millions of sacks. And if you were to lay out those sacks, their volume is as big as a tennis court. \nAnd that allows both the intake of more oxygen, but also the offload of carbon dioxide. So when you do the double inhale, it re-inflates any of these little sacks that have collapsed, and in doing so, it allows you to offload more carbon dioxide. \nSo if you're feeling stressed in any circumstance, inhale twice through the nose and then exhale long through the mouth. You can repeat it a second or even a third time. But typically, just one or two, maybe three physiological sighs are sufficient to bring your level of stress and alertness down very fast and allow you to feel more calm. ","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":3,"dataSources":null}},{"id":8,"attributes":{"title":"How to Control Stress in Real-Time","slug":"how-to-control-stress-in-real-time","createdAt":"2023-02-02T14:08:24.693Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-06T03:20:00.435Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-02T16:13:02.774Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/321576/pexels-photo-321576.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"An ability to control your levels of stress in real time is extremely powerful. It turns out you can do this using physiology and neuroscience. Your breathing can directly impact your heart rate and your level of stress, or calm. \n\nHere’s how it’s works. When you inhale, your diaphragm moves down. This creates more space in your thoracic cavity, and your heart actually gets a little bigger. As a result, the rate of blood flow through that larger heart volume slows down. \n\nA signal is sent from a group of neurons on your heart called the sinoatrial node. That signal goes up to the brain, and your brain sends a signal to speed the heart up. In other words, inhaling speeds your heart rate up. \n\nThe opposite is true as well. When you exhale, your diaphragm moves up, your heart gets a little bit smaller because there’s a little bit less space in your thoracic cavity. As a result, blood flows more quickly through that smaller volume. \n\nThe sinoatrial node registers that and signals your brain, and the brain signals to slow the heart down. So, in other words, inhaling speeds your heart rate up. Exhaling slows your heart rate down. \n\nSo if you want to speed up your heart rate and be more alert, inhale more or make those inhales more vigorous, more intense, if you want to calm down, you can do that quickly by making your exhales slightly longer than your inhales or making them more vigorous. \n\nThis doesn’t require any breath work. This is something that you can do in real time, and that’s what’s called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. That’s the technical phrase. It’s also the basis of what’s called heart rate variability, or HRV. \n\nBut all you need to remember is inhaling deeper and longer will speed your heart rate up. Exhaling. Longer and more intensely will slow your heart rate down and will allow you to calm down in real time. ","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":2,"dataSources":null}},{"id":9,"attributes":{"title":"7 Health Benefits of Green Tea & How to Drink it ","slug":"7-health-benefits-of-green-tea-and-how-to-drink-it","createdAt":"2023-02-03T00:43:29.954Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-04T23:25:41.432Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-03T00:43:32.258Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1417945/pexels-photo-1417945.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"This article is going to be all about the health benefits of green tea. I’ve seen some overblown claims, so we’re going to parse through and figure out what’s what. Also, read till the end of the article to get tips on how to make the healthiest cup of tea possible. \n\nTea is one of those rare beverages that’s pretty much universally accepted by science as a healthy one. But just remember. As with everything in. Life, you can have too much of a good thing. So don’t overdo it with the green tea. \n\nThe number one thing that makes green tea so good for you is that it’s loaded with healthy nutrients. All of these bioactive polyphenols are awesome for your health. You may have heard of some of them known as flavonoids or catechins. \n\nAnd what those are just antioxidants. What antioxidants do is prevent free radical damage to your body, and free radical damage to your body over time causes cancer. But let me break that down a bit. \n\nI know all of you have faucets at home, whether it’s in your bathroom or in your kitchen. Some of those faucets have rust on them. The rust is a direct result of that free radical damage we always talk about. \n\nNow, antioxidants prevent that rust from forming. So think of antioxidants as the rust prevention within our own bodies. Within media, it’s been mentioned before that those who drink green tea have lower rates of cancer, and it’s been theorized that it has something to do with the huge amount of antioxidants found within green tea. \n\nWe have to not get too excited by this fact, because this is only a correlation and not a causation. Yes, it’s good to drink green tea, but no, it’s not going to cure and prevent all types of cancer. \n\nSecond significant point about green tea, if you got stinky breath, maybe you should try some green tea. The nutrients within green tea that we just mentioned on this last point, known as catechins, do a great job of inhibiting and killing certain types of bacteria. \n\nIn fact, studies were done and proved that bacteria known to cause bad breath within your mouth was killed by drinking green tea. Also, when you have less of that specific bacteria, you have less plaque. So green tea also decreases the risk of developing a cavity.\n\n Point three about green tea. It does a great job of giving you stable energy without all the jitters. It has about 30 to 50 milligrams of caffeine, which is roughly half a cup of coffee. \n\nYou’re still focused, you’re still stimulated, but you don’t have that jittery feeling that you get yet with a big cup of coffee. Another nutrient within green tea that works together with caffeine to boost your brain function is called Althea. \n\nIts benefit is that it gives your brain relaxation without the added sedation or drowsiness that comes along with other relaxing agents. While we’ve seen in animal and lab models, it increases your good cholesterol and lowers your bad cholesterol, what we found in animal lab and human trials is that green tea lowers your blood pressure. \n\n Point number five: green tea can help you burn fat. Well, this is more of an individual case-by-case basis thing, because not all studies agree on this. \n\nBut there is a promise of increased metabolism and fat oxidation, essentially fat burning. Some of the lab models have shown a decrease in new blood vessel formation within your fat stores, meaning that it literally takes away the vital nutrition for your fat and makes it die. \n\nPoint number six: Animal and lab models both show that catechins the nutrient we keep mentioning repeatedly decrease the risk of you developing Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Science isn’t clear on why this occurs, but it’s theorized that it has something to do with the decrease in the development of plaque within the brain. If that doesn’t encourage you to take a sip, I don’t know what will.\n\nPoint 7: Now, this is the game changer. This is the one that everyone gets excited about. Green tea may increase your lifespan. There’s been a ton of research done on this. \n\nSome studies even have 40,000 participants that show those who drink three to five cups of tea a day have an increased lifespan, have a decreased all, cause mortality. That means dying from anything, has decreases in heart disease, decreases in strokes. \n\nBut before we get too excited, we need to remember correlation versus causation. Just because those who drink green tea live longer, it doesn’t mean green tea is the sole thing that’s responsible for that effect. \n\nSo, yes, enjoy your green tea, but don’t think you’re going to live forever. Here’s how you create the healthiest cup of tea possible. Don’t add green tea directly to boiling water as it destroys those healthy categories we’ve been talking about. \n\nDon’t go decaf because the decaffeination process hurts more of the nutrients found in green tea. Add lemon into your tea as it aid in the absorption of some of these nutrients.  ","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":5,"dataSources":null}},{"id":10,"attributes":{"title":"Intermittent Fasting: Pros and cons","slug":"intermittent-fasting-pros-and-cons","createdAt":"2023-02-03T01:44:22.565Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-04T23:30:43.135Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-03T01:52:01.953Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/70497/pexels-photo-70497.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Our bodies enter a fasting state every time we’re asleep. Some people do intermittent fasting and do not even know it. I mean, there’s plenty of times where I had a stressful rotation in medical school or a difficult job in the hospital where I didn’t have time to eat breakfast. \n\nThat’s a form of intermittent fasting. And our bodies are totally capable of handling this. I know what you’re thinking. I don’t want to starve myself for health benefits. Intermittent fasting is not starving. \n\nWhen you’re fasting, your body is using stored nutrients and stored energy forms in order to make your body continue to function. When you’re starving, you run out of those energy sources and are breaking down vital tissues like organs to get that same energy. \n\nThere are many different ways to go about going on one of these diets. And that not only makes it confusing for you, but that also makes it very difficult to do research on it to find out how effective it truly is. \n\nBecause if there are multiple ways to do it, we have to be able to test each one of those ways. The 16/8 diet which is not eating during 16 hours of the day. Alternate day fasting, where you eat one day fast, the other day five and two were two days of the week that you’re fasting. \n\nThere’s no hard and fast rule saying that this is the correct way of doing it. You may be wondering how is IF beneficial to me? There’s been a lot of proposed health benefits. Many of them have been proven within animal studies or lab models, which is not the same thing as being proven in a human model, but they are very promising. \n\nNow, those benefits include increased mental sharpness, a favorable hormonal profile, weight loss. Decreases of inflammation within the body, decreases of certain diseases within the body. How can IF help you lose weight? \n\nYou have an increase in growth hormone, a decrease in insulin, and that alone will help you lose weight. Next, because you’re skipping meals or even going days without eating meals, it’s very likely that when you look throughout the week, you’ll be eating fewer calories. \n\nOur thinking is that during 8 hours you’ll eat less than you would if you were eating during 16 hours. Let’s talk about these other health benefits. We know that chronic stress is not good for the body. \n\nThe body is just not meant to be chronically stressed out. It’s not meant to have a high heart rate, high blood pressure. Intermittent fasting is really a form of acute short term mild stress. This type of acute short term stress is really good for the body. \n\nWhat can we use as a metaphor here? Let’s take exercise. Exercise is a form of acute mild stress. What happens after exercise? We have benefits for the brain. We have benefits for weight loss. We have benefits for disease prevention. \n\nNow, similarly, when you stress your body through intermittent fasting, there are some benefits. More autophagy, which is the removal of cellular waste, more production of neurotrophic factors, which protect your brain, and a favorable hormonal profile with increases in human growth hormone and norepinephrine. \n\nLet’s talk about some of the shortcomings of IF. Primarily, there’s not enough guidance on what you should eat. We don’t know how many calories. We don’t know what foods to eat on the days or times that you actually are eating. \n\nSecond, we don’t know which form of IF is best. Third, there are some side effects when you are fasting that people do experience heading aches, mental fog, heartburn. These things do exist. It’s not totally benign. \n\nFour. We don’t know the consequences of following an intermittent fasting diet long term. Most, if not all, of these studies are done on the short term. If you are eating a very unhealthy diet and then make a change, you’re definitely going to see a benefit. ","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":4,"dataSources":null}},{"id":11,"attributes":{"title":"I went VEGAN For 30 Days | Here's How My Body Reacted...","slug":"i-went-vegan-for-30-days-here-s-how-my-body-reacted","createdAt":"2023-02-03T04:11:22.897Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-04T23:30:13.831Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-03T04:11:25.351Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1351238/pexels-photo-1351238.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Honestly, I was really proud of myself, and it’s nice every now and then to take a challenge like this and learn something new about yourself.  \nFive things I Learned to be vegan for 30 days ...\nIn fact, I want to tell you five things that I learned not only about the vegan diet but also about myself during this process. One, when I didn’t plan well; I ate very unhealthy when I was at MIT for breakfast. I ate cinnamon toast Crunch with almond milk and a banana every morning. That’s not healthy, even though it’s vegan. \nTwo, I didn’t notice a major change in my energy level like I thought I would. I mean, maybe I had a slightly decreased energy level, but we remember I was sick in the beginning. I was under eating calories, so I don’t feel it’s fair to blame vegan for that. \n\nThree, surprisingly, I didn’t get weaker on vegan. I was lifting strong, and I felt good. But what suffered was getting to the gym. I really noticed the lack of willpower when I was following the restrictive diet. \nFour, when it comes to my body, I lost 3 pound. I dropped from 203 to 200 pounds. So there was some weight loss, probably from under-eating calories, but despite losing weight, I didn’t feel as lean. I mean, all those sauces, all the rice that I ate, pasta that contributed to the car bloat and probably made me feel a little bit pudgier than usual. \nFive, this is the big one. The real difficulty was my GI system. I mean, it was a mess. The amount of gas and flatulence and bloating. God, I can’t. It’s, like, gross even talking about, but it was terrible. \n\nIf you have that with any diet, there’s no way you’re sticking with it. And I tried taking some over-the-counter supplements for this. It did absolutely nothing.\n\nMy advice to you .....\nIf you’re curious or interested in starting a vegan diet, I don’t want to dissuade you. In fact, I want to encourage you. Go talk to a dietitian nutritionist physician, someone who’s well versed in vegan diets. That way you could do it the healthy, happy, safe way without hurting yourself in the process. \nAnd please reduce the amount of refined carbs and processed foods that you’re eating, because as more research comes out, that’s the stuff that causes diseases and shortens your lifespan.

There’s some really interesting relationships between the gallbladder and your thyroid. So let’s first start out talking about what is bile. Bile is composed of many things.\n\nYou, first of all, have bile salts in the bile, and that’s made out of potassium, sodium, calcium. So 67% of bile is bile salts. But then you also have something else in bile salts, and that’s called lecithin. So 22% of bile is made out of lecithin, and lecithin is a choline compound that helps you break down fat and cholesterol.\n\nSo bile is made out of bile salts, lecithin, which has choline in it. Also, bile is made up of cholesterol. And that’s really how bile salts are created from cholesterol. And if there’s too much cholesterol and not enough bile salts, that’s when you get gallstones.\n\nSo we have the cholesterol. Now, the protein is mainly two amino acids that combined with this bile to allow it to be water soluble and transported through the body. So that allows it to travel through the body in a very similar way to cholesterol being attached to a protein. So cholesterol is really, really important.\n\nNow, what’s interesting about the thyroid is when the thyroid is low, you have this hypothyroid condition, and even if it’s subclinical, so it’s not like a major problem. It’s a smaller problem that is going into the direction of a full-blown hypothyroid situation. Here you are having all this cholesterol in the body, but it’s not really broken down. So you get the situation where you’re getting a buildup of more cholesterol without the bile to break it down.\n\nAnd so, again, we have another risk of getting gallstones because we’re getting more cholesterol. The body can’t use it without the bile salts. So you have this super saturated cholesterol stone that’s developing. Also, your bile ducts won’t be able to relax if the thyroid hormones are sluggish.\n\nIf the thyroid is sluggish, you’re going to be on the cold side. The activation of the enzymes in the liver are not going to be that great as well as the formation of bile. Now, on the flip side, bile salts help in the conversion of T4 to T3 to actually activate the thyroid hormones. T4 is the inactive version of the thyroid hormone, T3 is the active version.\n\n To help this conversion, bile is needed. So you may have a lot of thyroid hormone, like T4, but you can also experience the symptoms of a hypothyroid because you’re not being activated. It takes a really healthy thyroid to make good bile, but it also takes bile to actually create a healthy thyroid. So one big common problem, probably the most common problem with a hypothyroid situation, is that the person has an autoimmune type hypothyroid situation.\n\nIt’s not really a thyroid problem. It’s an immune problem that’s attacking the thyroid. Another common cause of thyroid problems is a high level of cortisol. It’s adrenal stress, and that can shut down the thyroid.\n\nSo the thyroid is secondary, the adernal is primary, and a couple of reasons for that. So if you are on a low-fat diet or a plant-based diet, you’re not going to get enough cholesterol. And that could be the very reason why the adrenals tank down and the thyroid goes down, because you don’t have the raw material to make these hormones. Just by supplying more fat, going on a healthy version of the ketogenic diet can supply the raw material to start making more adrenal hormones.\n\nThat can then reduce the cortisol situation and give relief to your thyroid. And remember, it takes cholesterol to make bile. So being on a low-fat diet or a low-cholesterol diet can cause you not to even make enough bile, cannot activate the thyroid hormones, so we need that cholesterol. Also, what activates the production of bile is fat in the diet, animal fats.\n\nSo if you’re not having enough animal fats, you just don’t make enough bile. That right there can increase your risk of gallstones as well as your risk of getting a hypothyroid situation, because, one, we don’t feed the adrenal hormones, okay, so then we get higher cortisol, and we don’t make enough bile to make the conversion from T4 to T3.

But there’s one thing that’s very, very important, and I want to just talk about it, and that's changing your viewpoint about the environment. I know this might be hard to believe, but your environment is not as dangerous as they want you to believe. Recently, I started to really look at the videos and different TV programmes I was watching, and it just hit me how many messages of fear I was exposed to without any solutions.\n\nNow, I’m definitely not saying to ignore some of these dangers, but when you are exposed to them, try like heck to have a relaxed viewpoint, staying in action to help solve the problem and improve things. But at some point, we need to start filtering out this threat of danger because it’s just not healthy for our bodies. You should start watching TV programmes and hang out with people who give you solutions that emphasise the good news. Talk about the good things to offset the massive danger signals that our body is constantly fed.\n\nNow, let me just go through a couple of things, because this is actually a very important topic. That is the flutter fight, the protective mode we enter in response to the threat of stress. Whereas the other system, called the parasympathetic, is all about growth, sleep, digestion, repair, and healing. In practice, I used to have a test called a «heart rate durability test» that would measure how much of the sympathetic nervous system was being activated versus how much parasympathetic.\n\nAnd boy, nearly everyone that came in was just so jacked up to the right, which is Because the environment we're in is considered extremely dangerous, we have sympathetic dominance. I mean, if there aren't enough things going wrong, to have other people manufacture more of them is complete insanity. So, I believe it is critical that you understand what happens to your biology when you are subjected to long-term chronic stress. Let’s go on to the immune system.\n\nStress suppresses the immune system. And therefore, when you go to the doctor and you have inflammation or some type of autoimmune disease, they inject you with prednisone, which takes that away temporarily because prednisone is a type of cortisol that is produced by the adrenal glands, which are activated by stress, and that is suppressing all the immune reactions. You have decreased sperm production. Well, if you’re trying to be on the ketogenic diet, your whole metabolism shifts back to glucose production.\n\nThat’s right, because cortisol is a glucocorticoid, so it increases glucose and neogenesis, the production of new sugar in your liver. So when you go through chronic stress, what’s happening is that you’re just pumping out all this sugar that’s not coming from your diet. Because when you’re in stress mode, your body needs this quick energy. When you go through chronic stress, your triglycerides go up, your HDL goes down, and your LDL goes up.\n\nYour ability to detoxify I’m talking about certain enzymes in your liver. These are the enzymes that convert poisons into harmless, water-soluble things that can be released from the body. Those are inhibited when you go through chronic stress. So there goes the fat digestion.\n\nEven your pancreatic enzymes and the enzymes from your small intestine will be inhibited, cutting down your ability to digest. Your production of hydrochloric acid is going to go down, too. So there goes your complete digestion of proteins, your absorption of minerals, and the killing of pathogens. On top of all the other barriers to vitamin D absorption, stress will actually slow down the absorption of vitamin D. Even the fascia, which is similar to the stuff that surrounds the muscles and is highly innovated by your nerves and brain, has a lot of information coming down to it, around the ligaments, around your muscles, and it tightens and becomes more restricted.\n\nWhen you’re under chronic stress, you maintain this posture right here, which is kind of like being in protection mode. You know, your posture starts going down, and it all has to do with that fascia. In a chronic state of stress, you will not be thinking analytically, thinking about things, solving problems, coming up with good solutions, being creative, or having imagination. Instead, it’s going to be more like reaction mode because you need a relaxed state of mind to come up with solutions.\n\nYou need your creativity to come up with really good strategies and solutions. The last point I want to bring up is your genes. What happens to your genes when you’re under stress? Well, all the bad genes get activated, okay? and all the good genes get suppressed. I’m talking about the activation of cancer genes.\n\nI’m talking about the activation of inflammatory genes and things like that. But one thing I want to bring up is that your genes really don’t cause anything. The genes are associated with a lot of bad things. But if you know how to control your genes, you’re totally going to be in the driver’s seat.\n\nNumber one, we must change our attitude towards our environment. We must also start filtering out the threat of danger to which we’re exposed. If you start watching certain videos that don’t give you a solution and at the end of the video you feel worse than before you watched the video, then you might need to filter those things out. Therapy for me is getting out in nature, getting as much space as possible, and really kind of getting connected to my environment.\n\nNow, the other thing to do is to physically flesh out a lot of this extra adrenaline and this extra cortisol that have been accumulated through the day of exposure to all these things. I mean, I have to physically work out every single day just to kind of flush things out and help me sleep. Because of the other point about the adrenaline and cortisol, it’s shifting a lot of energy that should be in your immune system, should be in repair, should be in digestion, and it’s ending up in the muscles. But because there’s no more tiger around, we have more mental energy, and that whole mechanism is still there.\n\nSo you’re going to have to exercise to get those hormones out of your system. Now, that being said, there are a lot of additional things you can do to help with stress. They're not as important as changing your viewpoint, but they’re still important.\n\n\n","tags":["chronic stress","immune system"],"readTime":11,"dataSources":null}},{"id":17,"attributes":{"title":"The top home treatments for candida fungus:NEVER AGAIN GET CANDIDA","slug":"the-top-home-treatments-for-candida-fungus-never-again-get-candida","createdAt":"2023-02-07T02:58:45.735Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-07T02:58:48.300Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-07T02:58:48.295Z","img":"https://wholehealthchicago.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Candida-copy.jpeg","metaDesc":"Today we'll talk about the best candida treatments.\n\nFungi make up a large portion of the microbes in your gut, and candida is one type of fungi.

Well, when you have sudden cardiac arrests or sudden cardiac death, you die right away. But when you have a heart attack, you may not die right away. \n\n\n\nIt’s usually involving an obstruction in the coronary artery that goes to the heart muscle itself. But with these other conditions, the electrical system of the heart just shuts down, and for the majority of time, it’s called idiopathic, which means they don’t know what causes it. \n\n\n\nSo I want to talk about the relationship between Omega-3 fatty acids and the electrical system of the heart, as well as how you can use fish oils to decrease the risk of sudden cardiac arrest or death. \n\n\n\nSo what is so special about these Omega-3 fish oils that you keep hearing about over and over and over, and how do they help you as far as the heart function?\n\n\n\nWell, first of all, they have several properties that involve the heart. \n\n\n\nAntiarrhythmic\n\n\n\nThey’re antiarrhythmic, which means they help the heart stay in rhythm.\n\n\n\nAnti-inflammatory\n\n\n\nThey’re anti-inflammatory, which anytime you reduce inflammation to the heart, you’re going to help the heart function. And if the inflammation goes too long, you can get fibrosis to the heart. \n\n\n\nTrigger Genes\n\n\n\nAnd it just so happens that these fish oils trigger genes that turn off the fibrosis effect of the heart.\n\nAntithrombotic\n\n\n\nFish oils are also antithrombotic, which means that they inhibit this thrombus or this clot formation. \n\n\n\nSo they help keep the blood on the thinner side so it doesn’t clot unnecessarily, even though if there’s a problem in the artery, you want it to clot. But fish oils can help prevent this inappropriate clotting. \n\n\n\nSupport the Endothelial layer\n\n\n\nFish oils also support this endothelial layer on the inside of your arteries, which is going to help your blood pressure, and it’s also going to prevent the formation of calcium and cholesterol from forming inside of the arteries. \n\n\n\nMake your cell membranes more fluid and less rigid\n\n\n\nBut despite all that, I think the biggest benefit that fish oils can do for your heart is make your cell membranes very fluid and less rigid. If we look at the opposite of Omega-3, we’re dealing with omega-6 fatty acids.\n\n\n\nAnd that would be all the seed oils, the vegetable oils, the soy oil, the cotton seed, safflower, sunflower oil, peanut oil. All these oils invade the cell membrane and make them more rigid. It’s extremely important that you have the ratios of omega-6 to Omega-3 correct. \n\n\n\nAnd they really should be like a one to one ratio. An average person in the US has like a 15 to 1 ratio to Omega-3 fatty acids. And so you can imagine the stiff arteries, you can imagine all the other problems that occur with these Omega-6. \n\n\n\nIncreasing insulin resistance, increasing the risk of obesity, increasing the risk of getting a fatty liver, and the list goes on and on and on. So based on that data, you might think, well, okay, well, I’m doing fish oils, I’m doing supplements, you stay, I’m fine. \n\n\n\nBut what you may not know is there’s a lot of the hidden sources of omega-6  fatty acids. And this omega-6 fatty acids compete with Omega-3. So the more that the omega-6 are in the diet, the less you’re going to get off the Omega-3. \n\nSo if you’re doing both of these at the same time, you’re really nullifying the effects of Omega-3. And this is very important to know.\n\n\n\nSo let’s go through some of the foods or the hidden foods that are high in Omega-6. \n\n\n\nWell, you have all the animals that are fed grains, like the commercial chicken, the commercial chicken-eggs, grain fed beef versus the grass fed beef. All of these are very high in omega-6. \n\n\n\nAll the grains, the bread, the pasta, the cereal, the crackers, are very high in Omega-6. Most of the nuts are high in Omega-6, except for walnuts do have a precursor to the Omega-3 fatty acids.\n\n\n\nAnd then what about all the salad dressings? \n\n\n\nTry to find a salad dressing that does not have vegetable oil. You want to make your own out of extra virgin olive oil and vinaigrette.\n\n\n\nThen we have the condiments like mayonnaise that’s usually made of soy oil. \n\n\n\nTry to find a mayonnaise that doesn’t have Omega-6 oils.\n\n\n\nWhat about hummus? Right? You buy hummus for yourself to dip your cucumbers. I mean, it’s very difficult to find hummus without Omega-6 oils. For some reason, they just don’t add the olive oil in the recipe. \n\n\n\nWell, I know the reason is just because it’s too expensive. But you want hummus with extra virgin olive oil, not soy oil or safflower oil.\n\n\n\nNow, farm-raised fish does, by the way, have more Omega-3 fatty acids than wild caught fish. \n\n\n\nHowever, it also has six times higher Omega-6 fatty acids than wild caught fish.\n\n\n\nAnd then we have restaurant food. I mean, it’s just loaded with Omega-6 fatty acids and the oils and fast food, especially typical French fries, deep fried and all the Omega-6 oils. \n\n\n\nSo this is a very important article. If you don’t know this information, start increasing your fish oils. Cognitive oil is a little bit better because it not only has the Omega-3 fatty acids, but it also has vitamin D and vitamin A, whereas fish oils don’t. \n\n\n\nHowever, fish oils are still good. Make sure you include salmon or fatty fish while caught in your diet on a regular basis.\n\n\n\nBut more importantly, really start avoiding these Omega-6 fats that seem to creep into our diet so often. \n\n\n\nAnd on top of that, it’s fascinating to me how the so called nutritional experts will tell you that you need to replace your saturated fats with the Omega-6. When there’s absolutely no evidence to show that’s going to improve your heart, shape or form. \n\n\n\nNow, if you haven’t read my article on COD liver oil, you should check that out.

How can I get longer? Or how can I get more girth? Well, today I am going to address those questions and give you the evidence behind penile lengthening treatments.  \n\n\n\nSo did you guys know that they did a survey of 50,000 heterosexual men? And what they found was that 55% of them were unhappy with the way their penis looked when they asked those men’s partners, 85% of women were satisfied with the way their partner’s genitals looked.  \n\n\n\nBut at the end of the day, it matters how you feel about your appearance. But there’s a lot of issues with that because pornography has really blurred the lines of what exactly is normal. So I made a article previously talking about the average penal length and average penal length, if you look at all the data, approximately the average penal length is about 5.2 inches or 13.2 cm. \n\n \n\nIt’s normal for penal length to be within two and a half standard deviations of that, so either greater or smaller. And so what’s considered abnormal in terms of length being too short would be anything less than 2.9 inches or 7.5 centimeters. And that’s called micro penis. \n\n\n\nMicro penis is prevalent in less than 1% actually 0.14% of the population. So it’s extremely rare. It can be due to several causes, which can include congenital abnormalities, hormonal abnormalities, previous surgeries, or cancer.  \n\n\n\nBut today we’re going to talk about people who have a normal penile length. \n\n\n\nSo while it is true that the large majority of people who are concerned with the size of their penis have a normal penal length based on these numbers, the true issue is that a significant portion of men can have distress related to the idea that their penis is not as long as they desire.  \n\n\n\nAnd this is a form of body dysmorphic disorder, actually has a term, it’s called small penis anxiety. Doesn’t mean that they have a small penis, but they have anxiety related to the fact that they believe that the size of their penis is not long enough.  ","tags":["penile lenth"],"readTime":9,"dataSources":["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2050052119300125?via%3Dihub"]}},{"id":30,"attributes":{"title":"What should be the Duration of Sex?","slug":"what-should-be-the-duration-of-sex","createdAt":"2023-02-19T00:02:33.947Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-19T00:02:36.807Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-19T00:02:36.804Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/4553619/pexels-photo-4553619.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Today, I’m going to tell you, based on data collected from 500 couples around the world, what is the average length of intercourse? \n\n\n\nIn modern society, we spend a lot of time glorifying what sex should look like, how long it should last, and putting a lot of value on this. But ultimately, all this pressure can have a real detrimental impact on our lives.  \n\n\n\nAnd what you hear about sex is not always accurate, particularly how long someone lasts in bed. \n\n\n\nSo here is true and timed data on what the average length of intercourse actually is. Before I launch into the data, it’s important to define what sex actually means.  \n\n\n\nWell, in this particular study, sex means penetration. So, from the initial penetration to the end of penetration, it does not include foreplay. That does not mean what sex should mean for you, but that’s how they define it in this study.  \n\n\n\nIn the data that I’m presenting, they are specifically talking about sex between men and women. But no matter what the data says, it’s important to communicate with your partner about what their expectations are and what they enjoy in a sexual relationship during intercourse and outside of it, because it’s different for each and every person.  \n\n\n\nAnd in order for you to have a fulfilling sex life, it’s important to communicate and always be open. \n\n\n\nSo what do men think the ideal length of penetrative intercourses? Specifically, in medical speak, we call it intra ejaculatory latency time.  \n\n\n\nIt is essentially the time from the beginning of penetration to ejaculation. And on average, they estimate the ideal length to be about 16 minutes. And the actual length, what they think people actually last for, is about 9 minutes.  \n\n\n\nBut what’s the data says? \n\n\n\nSo, if you look at these 500 couples from around the world, they were actually asked to use a stopwatch to time their intra ejaculatory latency time. What they found was the average length was 5.7 minutes.  \n\n\n\nThere was a range which included anywhere from 0.1 minute to about 55 minutes. So some people had longer intra ejaculatory latency time. \n\n\n\nAnd interestingly, it varied by location.  \n\n\n\nSo Turkey had the lowest IELT of 4.4 minutes and the UK had the longest IELT of about 10 minutes. \n\n\n\nSo that’s what the average sex duration is? And what do women want? \n\n\n\nWell, there’s no good scientific study on this, but on a poll which was done by a website of 4000 women, what they found was the average length of time that women desire to have penetrative intercourse was 25 minutes.  \n\n\n\nAgain, this is variable from person to person.

It might be, hey, I think you should maybe go to the bathroom soon. And soon it becomes, hey, you should go very suits.

And so then you continue doing whatever it is you’re doing, like watching a movie or writing a paper or whatever it is that you can’t get up from. \n\nAnd then eventually the urge comes back and then you go again and do the same thing.

Does it take you long to ejaculate or you never get there? Read this article until the end and learn what causes delayed ejaculation and what you can do to treat it.\n\nDelayed Ejaculation: What can you do about it?  \n\nAre you having a hard time finishing? Well, today we’re going to talk about delayed ejaculation. \n\nDefinition of Delayed Ejaculation\n\nSo, delayed ejaculation is a condition where it takes a man longer than usual to achieve climax and ejaculate, and usually the number that we see is anywhere between 20 and 30 minutes.  \n\nHowever, the clinical definition is a little bit more stringent, and it is a marked delay or marked  infrequency of ejaculation that has occurred almost 75% to 100% of the time in the last six months, and that causes the individual distress or bother.  \n\nAnd this is pretty uncommon. It occurs in about 1% of men where they have a lifelong delayed ejaculation and 4% of men where they get acquired delayed ejaculation. \n\nIn this article, we’re going to cover the physiology of erection, the causes, the diagnosis, and the treatment options for delayed ejaculation. So make sure to stick around until the end. \n\nDefinition of Ejaculation\n\nSo ejaculation is the process of releasing semen from the body, and it occurs in many steps. The first step is emission, where semen enters the urethra through the ejaculatory duct and the bladder neck closes to make sure that your semen will not go backwards into the bladder.  \n\nAnd the process of expulsion, where the semen is pushed out through the urethra, usually with the support of the pelvic floor muscles and the muscles around the urethra called the bubble cavernosis muscles.  \n\nInterestingly, ejaculation is a reflex. Once you get to the point where your body sends signals to your spinal cord and then to your brain that you need to ejaculate, ejaculation occurs and there’s nothing you can do to stop it.  \n\nAnd typically, orgasm occurs at the same time as ejaculation. But orgasm is a brain triggered event whereas ejaculation is a spinal cord triggered event. And so these can occur her most often together, but not always.  \n\nAnd specifically, some hormones, like dopamine, are increased during orgasm, whereas other hormones, like prolactin, are suppressed. So some of the medical treatments, all of which are off label, kind of try to work with these hormones to help improve the time to ejaculation and orgasm.  \n\nWhat causes delayed ejaculation?\n\n Well, there’s a number of different causes. It can be psychological, meaning that it’s due to something in your brain or something that’s bothering you in your brain or it can be physiological, meaning that’s from your body and sometimes it can be a combination of both.  \n\nPsychological issues\n\nSo psychological issues can be many. It can be due to certain fears you have. It can be due to having strong religious convictions or guilt associated with ejaculation. It can be due to relationship conflicts.  \n\nIt can be due to idiosyncratic masturbation techniques which I’ve talked about before in my article about when the small chances where masturbation can become harmful. It can be due to performance anxiety. Or the lack of stimulation or arousal. So all of these things can contribute to a psychological delayed ejaculation. \n\n Physiological causes, meaning from your body that you cannot control can be due to things like having surgery which affects the nerves that carry those signals to the spinal cord to cause the ejaculatory reflex or having medical conditions like multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury where we see this quite often.  ","tags":["ejaculation"],"readTime":7,"dataSources":null}},{"id":34,"attributes":{"title":"According to an Urologist, 10 Amazing Ways to Increase Your Sexual Pleasure","slug":"according-to-an-urologist-10-amazing-ways-to-increase-your-pleasure","createdAt":"2023-02-22T23:31:02.271Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-22T23:31:03.956Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-22T23:31:03.953Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/4541585/pexels-photo-4541585.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Are you satisfied with the state of your sexual relationship?\nOr would you like to give it a little more boost?

But first, a little background on vitamin K2. in a book called “Nutrition and Physical Degeneration” by Dr. Weston Price.</p><p data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">&nbsp;</p><p>He was a dentist, but he did a lot of research and visited these remote cultures that ate very healthy foods, and he was trying to identify what it was about their diet that generated such amazing teeth as compared to nowadays, when everyone needs braces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have our wisdom teeth extracted because there is insufficient space in our skull. The teeth are overcrowded. I have a lot of overbite and underbite issues, not to mention my teeth. I pretty much had cavities in every single tooth in my skull.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So Western Price looked at the calcium. He looked at the fat-soluble vitamins. Maybe at first he thought it was vitamin D, vitamin A, or vitamin E, but at the time, vitamin K2 wasn’t identified. And so it was really interesting that he had a term for it called “activator X,” kind of like the X factor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just something to supplement the regular fat cycle vitamins that are promoting really good teeth, such as really good bones, bone structure, and overall health.He just didn’t know about vitamin K2 because it hadn’t been discovered yet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And so he looked at cultures in the Swiss Alps, and he found that they ate a lot of grass-fed butter and cheese and really natural things. And so he identified their teeth as being just, like, really, really good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fast forward. We know now. It’s Vitamin K2. There’s vitamin K1, which is all about clotting. And then there’s vitamin K2, which is all about calcium transportation. Vitamin K2 works with vitamin D.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, vitamin D helps a person absorb calcium in the intestines by a factor of 20. If someone doesn’t have enough vitamin D, calcium really won’t be absorbed in the blood very well. And so vitamin D is all about raising calcium in the blood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But vitamin K2 takes it to the next level. It takes the calcium from the blood and pushes it into the bone. And so the way it does this is by activating certain proteins. And another thing that’s really interesting about vitamin K2 is that it uses a transport system called LDL, the so-called “bad cholesterol” that everyone’s trying to avoid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, it takes a ride in LDL through the body, and then it ends up in your bones. So it makes your bones really, really solid. It helps certain parts of your teeth become very, very strong. It keeps calcium from building up in the arteries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It prevents vascular calcification. It also keeps calcium from accumulating in your cartilage or joints, which can lead to arthritis.So it’s all about calcium transportation. It activates a very important cell called a beta cell in your pancreas, which makes insulin more sensitive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So if a person has insulin resistance, which the majority of the population has, it can really help someone’s blood sugar by improving insulin resistance, because now that insulin is going to make insulin more sensitive, then your body can make less insulin.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It helps generate more ATP or energy in the muscle cell. You’re going to have a lot more energy to do exercise. It also is involved in supporting the cells that make testosterone. It also works on the brain.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It improves spatial learning as well as memory, which is pretty cool. And like I said before, it also inhibits this calcium build up in the arteries and in the joints. So you can see it’s a very, very important vitamin and we need to have it in our diet.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, there’s no requirements or RDAs for K2 yet, even though we need it now. The majority of vitamin K2 comes from bacteria. And so when a cow eats grass that is loaded with vitamin K1, that vitamin K1 changes into vitamin K2 with the help of bacteria, vitamin K1.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And vitamin K2 are fat-soluble vitamins, so it is stored in fat. So if someone goes low fat or they’re on medications that block cholesterol, for example, they may not not get enough vitamin K2.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At least the microbes in your own gut do make some of the vitamin K2 that you have in your body, okay? And that’s made from Vitamin K1. So there’s a little conversion going on in your gut.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And as a side note, E. Coli is one of the bacteria that has this ability to help you make vitamin K2. And I’m not talking about the pathogenic version. I’m talking about the version that is fairly friendly in your body. It actually makes certain B vitamins, and it also makes vitamin K2 from vitamin K1, which is interesting.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The number one food that has the most vitamin K2 is cheese. There is one other food that has more vitamin K2, but most people are not going to consume it. So I didn’t want to even mention that cheese is number two, but I’m just going to put it number one because most people will consume cheese.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The number one product is really NATO, which is a fermented soybean, which, if you ever tasted it, you probably would not like it too much. It’s kind of an acquired taste. It’s kind of like my dad lacking limb burger cheese, right, which basically has a very unique flavor, which we all couldn’t stand growing up.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But recently I tasted some of it and actually actually, now I kind of like it. It does not taste like it smells. But as far as the abundance of vitamin K2, cheese is at the very top of the list. Mainly it’s the hard cheeses, but it’s also in the soft cheeses.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But out of all of the hard cheeses and the soft cheeses, there’s one cheese that it ranks number one, and that is called the munster cheese, which is grown in the mountains of France where they create this cheese with raw milk, not the pasteurized milk, but they use in the US.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, it is true that vitamin K2 will survive some of the pasteurization, the heating of the cheese, but it also kills off the microbes, right, that are making the vitamin K2. So you’re always going to find more vitamin K2 in things that are more raw, especially when we’re getting the cheese.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There’s all sorts of versions of vitamin K2. There’s just kind of like these subset versions of vitamin K2. You have like the MK-4, MK-7, etc. But in cheese you have MK-4, MK-5, you have MK-6, MK-7, MK-8, and also MK-9.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So you have a huge variety of different versions of this vitamin K2 as compared to some other foods that may only have one version, like maybe MK-4 or MK-7. But if you can find some raw cheese, that would always be better.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Usually European cheese, high quality, hard cheeses are going to have a little bit more, soft cheeses will have a little bit less, but you’re still going to get a good amount of vitamin K2 in cheese.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, some people are going to say, well, wow, I thought this saturated fat, and the cheese was bad, right? It’s going to create heart problems. And now I’m confused because vitamin K2 removes the calcium out of the arteries and that also helps prevent heart disease.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So what’s more important, removing the calcium from the arteries or the cholesterol that’s building up from all the fatty foods? Well, it’s just to clear the confusion, I’m going to put some links down below of some clinical trials and I think you’ll find interesting, completely refuting this data that saturated fat will make you die earlier or increase your risk for heart attacks or other problems.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There’s absolutely no evidence to show that saturated fat is going to worsen your health or cause diabetes. Unfortunately, those recommendations that we should increase our unsaturated fats, the Omega-6 to replace the saturated fats, are bad information.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, I just have to say something about those recommendations, the governmental recommendations. First of all, anything related to health that’s recommended by the government might not be true. I mean, if you think about it, who is the government?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is there one person? Is there a group? Is there a panel? Are these recommendations slightly biassed because they come from various groups that can have influence over these policies? The answer is a big, fat yes. There’s definitely a revolving door between industry and government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>kind of goes back and forth. So take any health-related advice from the government with a grain of salt. So we have cheese, which is a really good source of vitamin K2. We also have grass-fed butter, which is made from cows, but grains have very little vitamin K2.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why is that? because grains don’t have a lot of vitamin K1. Grass has a lot of vitamin K1. This vitamin K1 is then converted into vitamin K2. So it’s grass-fed and grass-finished.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Or, to put it another way, 100% grass-fed. That’s what you want to consume, as far as butter and other foods are concerned, if you want to get more vitamin K2. The cool thing about butter is that it has great amounts of vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin D, and vitamin K2.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It’s really good for someone who has osteoporosis, osteopenia, osteomalacia, or even rickets. These are all problems with the bones. And then you have things like goose liver, duck liver, duck fat, and eel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, eel is loaded with vitamin K2. Beef liver or lamb liver The liver has vitamin K2. Ground beef. grass-fed hot dogs. I’m not talking about the processed hot dogs you might get at a baseball game or something.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I’m referring to high-quality, grass-fed, no-sugar-added, clean hot dogs with vitamin K2.I’m not referring to regular commercial bacon. I’m talking about higher-quality bacon that has vitamin K2.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, out of all the meats, pork contains the most vitamin K2, which is interesting. And then you also have things like sauerkraut. It’s a fermented product that contains vitamin K2 with the help of bacteria.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And also, cod liver oil is another great thing, especially for children growing up. A lactating woman and her growing child should consume high-quality cheese on a regular basis, unless there is an allergy, as well as high-quality butter and collaborative oil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And not only will that help them avoid getting braces, but it’s going to improve their entire health. And if you’re taking vitamin D, always make sure you take vitamin K2 with it because they work hand in hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes people are concerned with the toxicity of vitamin D, but if you take vitamin K2 and magnesium, you can greatly offset the toxicity that could potentially occur if you’re taking massive amounts for many, many months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, since you’re on the topic of vitamin K2, there’s a lot more to know about it.
