I’m considering that as one, the heart and vessels, the eye and the kidney.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The kidney is very susceptible to oxidative damage from high blood sugar and high insulin. Now, there’s a very interesting study that I put a link down below. You can check it out. It was done for eight weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was on mice, but it showed a complete reversal of the albumin creatin ratio. Okay. Using the ketogenic diet, because <strong>beta-hydroxybutyrate</strong>, which is a ketone, not only can provide an alternative fuel, but it has some real interesting benefits to the kidney, including the big one, which is decreasing oxidative stress.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So keto basically can counter the damage and destruction from a&nbsp;<strong>high-carb&nbsp;diet</strong>. And in just eight weeks, there was a partial recovery of kidney damage. So I’d be curious to see if they did it longer, what would happen?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ketones, by itself, go beyond just providing an alternative fuel. They actually have therapeutic benefits as well. There’s different stages&nbsp;of damage to the kidney, Stage 1 to 5, stage 5&nbsp;which is end stage renal failure, and in this stage, the kidney, which is a filter, just could no longer filter anymore, can’t filter the blood.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So you’re going to have excessive amounts of&nbsp;certain nutrients and deficiencies of other nutrients. So if you’re at this stage, you need to check with your doctor, because you can’t just supplement too much potassium, for example.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But what I want to talk about is before you get to this stage. I hear this all the time. Oh, I can’t take potassium because it’s dangerous for the kidney. The true data is that potassium can actually protect the&nbsp;kidney against damage.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So it’s totally okay to take potassium, and we need 4700 milligrams every single day. Now, if you’re doing intermittent fasting, you’ll need less.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The requirements go down because you’re recycling and you’re becoming more efficient with your minerals and other nutrients. But potassium is very-very beneficial for the kidney. The other problem that people run into when the kidney becomes damaged is protein in the body.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You have a protein deficiency, and you actually end up filling up with fluid. You’re getting edema, and taking certain oral amino acids can slow down the progression of kidney damage. So check with your doctor on that.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So if you really look at what’s happening to the kidney, you have all this glucose, this refined carb, the sugar, the insulin, it’s destroying the kidney function.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But those complications from the oxidation occur more when there’s not enough nutrient. So it’s very, very important to prevent this problem by consuming nutrient-dense&nbsp;foods. It’s the nutrient in the food that protects against the side effects and the complications of the oxidation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And you definitely want to be on a low-carb&nbsp;diet for sure. This is very-very beneficial for the kidney itself. So ultimately, the goal is to prevent this problem. If you’re already at stage five. Work with your doctor to see what you can eat and what you can’t eat. But I would try to follow a healthy keto plan and intermittent fasting as closely as possible. But there are certain types of foods that you’re going to have to avoid, and realize that you do not have to avoid potassium if you’re in these earlier stages.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All right, thanks for reading.&nbsp;</p>"}}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
