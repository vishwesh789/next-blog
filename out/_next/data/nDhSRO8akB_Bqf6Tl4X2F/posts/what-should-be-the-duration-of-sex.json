But ultimately, all this pressure can have a real detrimental impact on our lives.  \n\n\n\nAnd what you hear about sex is not always accurate, particularly how long someone lasts in bed. \n\n\n\nSo here is true and timed data on what the average length of intercourse actually is. Before I launch into the data, it’s important to define what sex actually means.  \n\n\n\nWell, in this particular study, sex means penetration. So, from the initial penetration to the end of penetration, it does not include foreplay. That does not mean what sex should mean for you, but that’s how they define it in this study.  \n\n\n\nIn the data that I’m presenting, they are specifically talking about sex between men and women. But no matter what the data says, it’s important to communicate with your partner about what their expectations are and what they enjoy in a sexual relationship during intercourse and outside of it, because it’s different for each and every person.  \n\n\n\nAnd in order for you to have a fulfilling sex life, it’s important to communicate and always be open. \n\n\n\nSo what do men think the ideal length of penetrative intercourses? Specifically, in medical speak, we call it intra ejaculatory latency time.  \n\n\n\nIt is essentially the time from the beginning of penetration to ejaculation. And on average, they estimate the ideal length to be about 16 minutes. And the actual length, what they think people actually last for, is about 9 minutes.  \n\n\n\nBut what’s the data says? \n\n\n\nSo, if you look at these 500 couples from around the world, they were actually asked to use a stopwatch to time their intra ejaculatory latency time. What they found was the average length was 5.7 minutes.  \n\n\n\nThere was a range which included anywhere from 0.1 minute to about 55 minutes. So some people had longer intra ejaculatory latency time. \n\n\n\nAnd interestingly, it varied by location.  \n\n\n\nSo Turkey had the lowest IELT of 4.4 minutes and the UK had the longest IELT of about 10 minutes. \n\n\n\nSo that’s what the average sex duration is? And what do women want? \n\n\n\nWell, there’s no good scientific study on this, but on a poll which was done by a website of 4000 women, what they found was the average length of time that women desire to have penetrative intercourse was 25 minutes.  \n\n\n\nAgain, this is variable from person to person.
