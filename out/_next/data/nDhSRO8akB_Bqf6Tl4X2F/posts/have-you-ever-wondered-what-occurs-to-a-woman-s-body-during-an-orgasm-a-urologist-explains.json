You’ll also see what we call vasocongestion and that’s because there’s increased blood flow to the genitals, specifically to the clitoris.  \n\nThe clitoris itself enlarges, the vagina elongates and widens and the uterus moves up and out of the way. \n\nThe vaginal walls begin to create lubrication and the labia minora actually thin to allow more space for the potential salas later on.  \n\nAnd the labia menora becomes dark and colored. Up to a half to three-fourths of women develop what we call the sex flush. That’s where you can see pinkish spots kind of developing all over the breast, the torso, the hands, the face and even the soles of the feet, the vaginal muscles and even the sphincter of the anus can begin to tighten and contract.  \n\nAnd this phase can last anywhere from several minutes to several hours. \n\nPlateau Phase\n\nThe next phase is the plateau phase, and this is right before you’re about to reach climax or orgasm. And it basically continues everything that’s occurring during the excitement phase.  \n\nBut the clitoris starts to become a little bit sensitive, and it actually withdraws underneath the clitoral hood. If you want a review about all the female anatomy I’m talking about, make sure you check out my article about female anatomy and if the G-⁠spot is real to learn and get a refresher.  \n\nThe glands of the vestibular, the outer part of the vagina, start to make more lubrication. The outer part of the vagina actually swells, and the pelvic floor muscles start to tighten. And this concludes with an orgasm.  \n\nDuring climax, you will see significant increases in heart rate, blood pressure, the pupils will dilate and sometimes you could even have involuntary vocalization. \n\n And fascinatingly, several studies have found that the pain threshold during climax decreases.  \n\nThe vagina and vulva itself also have some interesting changes. And the most pathonemonic finding is pelvic floor contractions occurring at approximately 0.8 sec intervals. And they can be anywhere from 3 to 15 sets of contractions and they can get periodically longer.  \n\nAnd interestingly, orgasms can last anywhere from a few seconds to up to 60 seconds. \n\nThis can also be correlated with other areas of the body contract, including the uterus as well as the rectal fincter.  \n\nAs many of you probably already know, reaching orgasm can be quite a euphoric state and some even describe it as the ultimate meditative state because you cannot, literally cannot, think of anything else.  \n\nResolution Phase\n\nAnd the last phase is the resolution phase. \n\n And during this time, blood pressure drops, your muscles relax and allows your body to kind of slow down from the excited state. And some women may experience a refractory period.  \n\nI’ve talked about this before in my article about multiple orgasms, so you can read that. \n\n But some women can easily have multiple orgasms or others will experience a refractory period, at which point they cannot again achieve climax.  \n\nAnd for some of those women, their clitters can become very sensitive. So it’s important to communicate with your partner if that partner happens to be a female, so that you can be sure to stop submitting them if they are very sensitive.  \n\nAll right, guys, I hope you enjoyed that very much. As always, take care of yourself. ","tags":["orgasm"],"readTime":4,"dataSources":null,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}},"body":{"id":44,"content":"<h2 data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">Have you ever wondered what happens to a woman’s body when she orgasms?&nbsp;</h2><p data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">&nbsp;</p><p>And today we’re going to talk all about what happens to the body, the heart rate, the breathing and everything else when a woman orgasm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, the way we learned about orgasm or the sexual response cycle is by two prominent researchers named Masters and Johnson and how they learned exactly what happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They observed sex workers having sex in their laboratory.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So while today that seems a bit crazy, this is actually how they learned they were actually able to orgasm.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>3 Phases of Orgasm</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Excitement Phase</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And so the first phase is called the excitement phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And during this time, you will see an increase in heart rate as well as a rise in blood pressure.
