You're not by yourself. Many women use vibrators to get the big O. In fact, according to a study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine in July 2009, 53 percent of women aged 18 to 60 have used a vibrator, with one-quarter having used it in the previous month. Furthermore, those who regularly used a vibrator were more easily aroused and better able to become lubricated and achieve an orgasm.\n\nSo, should you experiment with a vibrator? Absolutely. Here's why it's good for you and how to incorporate it into your sexual life, both alone and with a partner.","tags":["vibrator"],"readTime":5,"dataSources":["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7678782/"],"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}},"body":{"id":53,"content":"<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">In this article, I’m going to teach you how vibration can enhance your sex life in ways that you didn’t realize were possible.&nbsp;</p><p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In this article, I’m going to cover six reasons that vibration can enhance your sex life and why you should incorporate it.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Okay, so how does vibration actually work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The genitals contain a number of superficial and deep receptors, and these respond to different things like temperature, pressure, stretch, and pain. Specifically for vibration, there are specific receptors called pecinian corpuscles, and these detect vibration and send these signals then to the brain stem and the brain to help our brains process exactly what that sensation is.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With these signals bring the number one reason to try vibration.&nbsp;</p><h2>1. Vibration increases blood flow to the genitals</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The vibration itself causes an increase in the stretch of the blood vessels called vasodilation, causing increased blood flow to kind of stay around the pelvic floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How does this work? Vibration causes an oscillating or fluctuating, meaning back-and-forth&nbsp;motion of the muscles. The stretching and shortening of the muscles increases the metabolic rate, causing the blood vessels to dilate, therefore allowing increasing blood flow to go in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This increasing blood flow can also cause the muscles to relax. So if you want to increase blood flow, they’ve actually looked at what kinds of vibration works best, and it actually depends on where you are in terms of your stimulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So in the initial parts of stimulation, if you stimulate it like on and off periodically, that increases blood flow more. And then, as the stimulation increases later points, a continuous stimulation may be more beneficial.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So it’s worth experimenting with your toys or whatever you’re using for vibration to see if something works better than another for you personally.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Vibration increases libido</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All this increased blood flow leads to increased arousal and desire to have sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, when they’ve looked at studies of men and women who have used vibrators in the past month versus those that have not, we use these validated questions looking specifically at sexual desires.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So they’ve looked at these questionnaires across multiple people to ensure that this answer to this question correlates with actual sexual desire levels. They found that women who’ve had vibrators in the last month all score higher with sexual desire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And similarly, men who’ve used vibrates in the last month tend to score higher in areas of libido as well compared to those who have not.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Vibration increases sexual performance</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The third reason to consider using vibration is to improve sexual performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And you might say, how does that even work?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, the studies have looked really mostly at men, but probably they’re translatable to women as well. The vibration itself stimulates fibers in certain types of nerves, like the cavernosal nerves and the pudendal nerves which are involved in sexual function.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This stimulation causes a release in nitric oxide. And I say this all the time, but nitric oxide is like an ignition for erections. You need a good amount of nitric oxide in order to have erectile function, and this then causes relaxation and allows blood to fill into the corpora or the erectile tissue of the penis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, vibratory stimulation is FDA approved for men with spinal cord injury to help induce ejaculation. It’s also been used successfully in men who’ve had prostatectomy to help restore erectile function.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So really great options for improving sexual function, and in spinal cord injuries, even improving ejaculation.&nbsp;</p><h2>4. Vibration can give more intense orgasms</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The number four reason to consider adding vibration into your sexual repertoire is that&nbsp;it can cause more intense and longer lasting orgasms.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is because vibration can stimulate different types of nerve receptors, specifically those precinct core puzzles we talked about earlier, that can lead to longer and more intense orgasms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, people who have difficulty achieving orgasms, or what we call an orgasmia, are actually treated with directed masturbation as a treatment and multiple studies that have been shown to be effective as a treatment for people who have difficulty achieving orgasm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also been shown that using vibration can shorten the time between orgasms in women. So women who tend to have multiple orgasms with vibration are also more likely to have multiple orgasms with their partner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>5. Vibration can improve sexual relationships</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In multiple studies, when they’ve asked couples who are open to their partner masturbating, men reported that women using a vibrator actually takes the pressure off them to make sure they’re partner orgasms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And potentially in patients who have limited energy or easily fatigued, it offers an alternative option. Most people who had partners who used vibrators said it actually enhanced their sexual relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And also it just provides a new avenue and new sensations to try out in foreplay or during intercourse that can really add a sense of adventure or excitement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>6. You can use vibration with or without a partner. So why not try it?&nbsp;</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a great way. Of course, to&nbsp;achieve orgasm&nbsp;by yourself quickly and reliably.&nbsp;</p><h2>7. Vibration is versatile</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You&nbsp;can use it for clitoral,&nbsp;vaginal, anal&nbsp;stimulation. You can use it with different speeds and different patterns to really identify what you like&nbsp;best and bring that knowledge to your partner when you’re having sex. And both of you&nbsp;will have a better and more enjoyable sexual experience.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
