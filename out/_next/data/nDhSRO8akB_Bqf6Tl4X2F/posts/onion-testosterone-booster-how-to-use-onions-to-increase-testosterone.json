And, of course, testosterone is definitely a problem with men as they get older. By the time you reach 40 every year, your testosterone decreases by 1%.</p><p data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">&nbsp;</p><p>And testosterone does many things beyond just increasing libido. It’s in control of male characteristics like hair on your body. It’s also involved in muscle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are quite a few of people that are also going the testosterone route and getting testosterone Pellets and taking testosterone injections, things like that, which I’m not crazy about those therapies simply because anytime you start taking a hormone, you inactivate the gland that makes that hormone.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So my question is, why would you need to increase the hormone in the first place?</strong></p><p><strong>What’s actually causing a decrease in that hormone?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Generally speaking, a much better approach would be more glandular therapy, supporting the gland with certain nutrition or even whole desiccated glandular.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because that way you’re supporting the thing that communicates not necessarily the communication between the gland and the receptor. Because really the endocrine system is a communication network very similar to neurotransmitters that work through the nervous system.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So hormones are created, sent through the blood, and get received to create different effects. And so when you tend to bypass Mother Nature, it always comes with a problem or a side effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But in this article, I want to talk just about something that won’t have any side effects,&nbsp;<strong>Onions</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Now, what does an onion do for testosterone?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, apparently, there’s something in the onion that triggers another hormone, called <strong>Luteinizing</strong> hormone from the pituitary. And <strong>Luteinizing</strong> hormone in males travels down to the testicles to increase testosterone.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So Luteinizing hormone is kind of like the controller or regulator of the production of testosterone.&nbsp;And onion based in about 29 different studies&nbsp;was about 75% effective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Onions</strong> also give you a lot of additional things.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It has properties to help with insulin resistance.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It gives powerful antioxidant effects.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It has anti-cancer properties,</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It can increase nitric oxide, which can help your vascular system.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But they have isolated one compound in onion called corsatin.&nbsp;And out of all 28 vegetables that were studied, onions had the highest amount of this compound. And so they’ve tested this compound, and they found that it does increase luteinizing hormone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It also helps the body, decreasing the risk of getting cataracts.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It may help reduce the risk of allergies.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It’s good for cancer.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It’s a potent anti-inflammatory.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It can help decrease blood pressure.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It can act as a diuretic.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So the best way to get this compound curseitin out of the onion is to consume it as raw as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, of course, you’re still going to get some if you saute the onion or even cook it, as long as you don’t overcook it. So here are some really practical ideas on how to get more onions in your diet. I always like to cut a slice of onion with my hamburger, in my eggs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes I do grilled onions in different dishes. I use onions in guacamole and salsa. Sometimes I put it in my salad. I put it in my soups. So there’s many different ways to do this, and it’s a real simple, no brainer way to indirectly increase your testosterone through increasing the curseitin.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But there’s many other ways to increase or boost testosterone. And if you haven’t seen this article&nbsp;on testosterone, it’s essential I put it up right here.&nbsp;</p>"}}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
