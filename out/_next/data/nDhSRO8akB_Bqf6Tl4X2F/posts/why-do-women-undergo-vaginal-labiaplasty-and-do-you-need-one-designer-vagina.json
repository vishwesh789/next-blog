Women may choose to have this procedure for various reasons, such as discomfort during physical activities, irritation or chafing, aesthetic concerns, or feeling self-conscious about the appearance of their genitalia.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all women need or want vaginal labiaplasty, and it should always be a personal choice made after careful consideration and consultation with a qualified medical professional. It's also essential to have realistic expectations about the results of the procedure and to understand the potential risks and complications associated with any surgery.\n\nThe term \"designer vagina\" is a controversial and potentially harmful term that implies that women need to alter the appearance of their genitalia to meet certain beauty standards. It's important to recognize that there is a wide range of normal and natural variation in the appearance of genitalia, and that no one should feel pressured to conform to narrow beauty standards or societal expectations.\n\nIf a woman is considering vaginal labiaplasty, it's important to seek out a qualified and experienced surgeon who can provide information, support, and guidance throughout the process. Ultimately, the decision to undergo any type of surgery should be based on individual needs and preferences, and should always prioritize physical and emotional well-being.","tags":["Labiaplasty"],"readTime":5,"dataSources":null,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}},"body":{"id":55,"content":"<p data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">What’s the deal with this designer vagina thing? Do you need a labiaplasty? Should you get one? Why do people even get them?</p><p data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">&nbsp;</p><h2>Labiaplasty</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And so labiaplasty is essentially reconstruction or plastic surgery of the lips of the vagina, usually making them smaller or more aesthetically pleasing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There’s been a huge growth in women getting labiaplasty, and this has actually increased by almost 80% between 2015 and 2019.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Why do women get labiaplasty?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Very simply, some people may just be dissatisfied with the way their labia look.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other times, people are trying to minimize any physical discomfort they might feel from their genitalia due to rubbing or friction in that area, which may cause pain or discomfort with just day-to-day activities and during sex itself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of this comes from what exactly is normal? What should your labia or your vulva even really look like?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, there was a point in time at which, during pornography, all volvas look the same with really small labia that were not protruding or going out of the body.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But in fact, we know that labias look very different person to person. And in fact, it’s just as likely for women to have a protruding labia as they do a small labia that many people see pictured in pornography or other things like that.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, in a survey of women, 73% of women who describe their genitalia as being abnormal had visible labia minora, and one in five women overall think there’s something wrong with their genitalia: either the appearance, the smell, the taste.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not uncommon. In fact, I talk about how this is very common in men with things like small penis anxiety, but women also have anxiety about the appearance of their genitalia.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While low self-esteem is a really important mental health issue that can contribute to a lot of poor health outcomes, the other issue is that women who perceive their genitalia as abnormal are less likely to undergo cervical cancer screenings, and so they could potentially miss out on screening for cervical cancers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, just like any other cosmetic surgery, if you understand the risks and benefits and you have distress or discomfort or stress due to the appearance of your genitalia, then this is certainly a reasonable option for you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you need it if you’re not bothered by the way your labia look?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Absolutely not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And as I mentioned earlier, there is a huge variety of different kinds of Volva appearances and labia appearances, and every one of them is completely normal.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Labiaplasty proccedure</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So these are most often performed by plastic surgeons, gynecologists, or urologists. And it really depends on the surgeon's preference and what your preference is.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Typically, there’s two techniques that are most often used.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One is called a <strong>wedge resection</strong>,&nbsp;essentially a triangular shape portion of tissue is removed from the widest portion of the labia minora, whereas a <strong>trim resection</strong> is essentially trimming the entire edge of the labia.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And in fact, when you look at surveys of surgeons, they perform these pretty much equally, and it really depends on the individual preference of the patient as well as the appearance of the labia themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The good news is that most people do really, really well. The risks of this procedure are very low. In fact, about 7% of people need some sort of&nbsp;further surgical revision. And in less than 4%, there’s a wound issue that requires you to have kind of longer healing period or go back for a minor procedure to fix that wound issue.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Otherwise, things like chronic pain, infection, pain with sex, or bleeding are really rare in less than 1% of patients. But what I always tell patients is that it doesn’t matter if it happens to 1% of patients if it happens to you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So if you’re you’re going to go ahead with any surgery, whether it’s a labiaplasty or a surgery on your arm, as long as you can accept those risks and understand that there is a small risk of this happening, then you should go ahead and proceed with surgery.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>So how much do labiaplasty cost?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, in 2019, the average surgeon fee for a labiaplasty was a little bit over $2,900. That doesn’t include the anesthesia fees, the facility fees of where you’re having the procedure done, any of those things.&nbsp;So certainly discuss those at length with your surgeon and make an informed decision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
