You're not by yourself. Many women use vibrators to get the big O. In fact, according to a study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine in July 2009, 53 percent of women aged 18 to 60 have used a vibrator, with one-quarter having used it in the previous month. Furthermore, those who regularly used a vibrator were more easily aroused and better able to become lubricated and achieve an orgasm.\n\nSo, should you experiment with a vibrator? Absolutely.
