In fact, 233 studies over the course of almost 50 years and looked at what happened to total sperm count and sperm concentration.  \n\nAnd these, if you don’t know, are essentially parameters that we look at when we get semen analyses to assess if people are maybe subfertile or infertile and maybe contributing to difficulty having a child.  \n\nThey specifically looked at studies that didn’t include men who were there for infertility.
