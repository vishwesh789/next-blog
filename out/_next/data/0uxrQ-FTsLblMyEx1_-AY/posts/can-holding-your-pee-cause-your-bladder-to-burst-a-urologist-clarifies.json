An Urologist clarifies","metaDesc":"What happens when you hold your urine too long? Can your bladder actually burst?\n\nAnd today I’m going to answer just that. \n\nSo what happens when your bladder fills is that your bladder has receptors and these receptors send signals to the brain.  \n\nThat brain then sends you signals of urge. It might be, hey, I think you should maybe go to the bathroom soon. And soon it becomes, hey, you should go very suits. And other times it’s like, hey, you better go or you’re going to pee your pants right? We’ve all been there.\n\nSo what happens when you hold your urine?\n\nWell, when you hold it, your body can actually learn to override these signals because the average person can hold up to two cups of urine.  \n\nAnd so what happens is you get the urge, you distract yourself and the urge goes away. And so then you continue doing whatever it is you’re doing, like watching a movie or writing a paper or whatever it is that you can’t get up from. \n\nAnd then eventually the urge comes back and then you go again and do the same thing. And I’m sure everyone watching here has held their urine at some point for several hours, right? You’ve been watching a movie, you don’t want to get up.  \n\nYou’re in a long car ride, you don’t want to stop the car. And so we’ve all been there.
