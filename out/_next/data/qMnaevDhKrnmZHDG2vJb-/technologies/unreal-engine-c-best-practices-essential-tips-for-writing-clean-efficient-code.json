The engine has a strong emphasis on C++ programming, which means that developers must have a good understanding of the language to write clean and efficient code. In this article, we’ll explore some of the best practices for writing C++ code in Unreal Engine to help you write code that is easy to read, maintain, and optimize.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Use const and constexpr</h2><p>One of the best practices for writing C++ code in Unreal Engine is to use const and constexpr. These two keywords are used to specify variables that cannot be modified at runtime, which can help prevent errors and improve code clarity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Const is used to specify variables that cannot be modified after they have been initialized. For example, if you have a variable that represents the number of lives a player has, you could use const to ensure that it cannot be changed during the game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Constexpr is used to specify variables that are known at compile-time. This keyword allows the compiler to perform optimizations that can result in faster code execution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Use Smart Pointers</h2><p>Another best practice for writing C++ code in Unreal Engine is to use smart pointers. Smart pointers are a type of C++ class that manages the lifetime of an object. They can help prevent memory leaks and make it easier to manage memory in your code.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are three types of smart pointers in C++: unique_ptr, shared_ptr, and weak_ptr. Unique_ptr is used to manage a single object, shared_ptr is used to manage multiple objects, and weak_ptr is used to create a non-owning reference to an object.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Use RAII</h2><p>Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) is a C++ programming technique that ensures that resources are properly acquired and released. In Unreal Engine, this can be used to manage resources such as memory, file handles, and network connections.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>RAII is based on the principle that resources should be acquired during object construction and released during object destruction. This means that whenever you create an object, you should initialize any resources it needs and then release those resources when the object is destroyed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Use the UE_LOG Macro</h2><p>The UE_LOG macro is a logging system provided by Unreal Engine that can be used to log messages to the console or a log file. Logging is an essential part of debugging, and the UE_LOG macro provides a convenient way to log messages in your C++ code.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The UE_LOG macro takes two parameters: a category name and a message. The category name is used to identify the source of the log message, and the message is the text that will be logged. For example, you could use UE_LOG to log a message when a player collects a power-up in your game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Use Precompiled Headers</h2><p>Precompiled headers can be used to improve the compile time of your C++ code. In Unreal Engine, you can use precompiled headers to include commonly used headers and reduce the number of times they need to be parsed during compilation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Precompiled headers work by precompiling header files and storing the resulting code in a cache. When the compiler encounters a header file that has been precompiled, it can simply use the precompiled code instead of parsing the header file again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Use Inline Functions</h2><p>Inline functions can be used to improve the performance of your C++ code. In Unreal Engine, you can use inline functions to reduce the overhead of function calls and improve code efficiency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Inline functions are functions that are expanded by the compiler at the point where they are called. This means that the function code is inserted directly into the calling code, eliminating the overhead of a function call.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Use TArrays Instead of Raw Arrays</h2><p>TArrays are a type of dynamic array provided by Unreal Engine that can help improve code safety and performance. Unlike raw arrays, TArrays automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation, making it easier to avoid common memory-related errors such as buffer overflows and memory leaks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to providing automatic memory management, TArrays also provide a range of useful functions that make it easier to work with arrays. For example, TArrays provide functions for adding and removing elements, sorting elements, and searching for elements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Use Range-Based For Loops</h2><p>Range-based for loops are a C++11 feature that can make it easier to iterate over elements in an array or container. In Unreal Engine, you can use range-based for loops to iterate over elements in a TArray or TSet, making your code more concise and easier to read.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Range-based for loops work by iterating over each element in a range of values, such as an array or container. The syntax for a range-based for loop is as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">for (auto&amp; element : container)\n{ // Do something with element }\n</code></pre><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this example, <code><strong>container</strong></code> is the array or container you want to iterate over, and <code><strong>element</strong></code> is a reference to the current element in the loop.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Use BlueprintImplementableEvent</h2><p>BlueprintImplementableEvent is a C++ macro provided by Unreal Engine that can be used to define a virtual function that can be overridden in Blueprint. This allows you to define C++ functionality that can be extended or modified by designers using Blueprint, making it easier to implement gameplay features without requiring additional C++ code.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To use BlueprintImplementableEvent, you define a virtual function in your C++ code and annotate it with the macro. Here’s an example:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><pre><code class=\"language-plaintext\">UCLASS() \nclass MyActor : public AActor \n{ \nGENERATED_BODY() \npublic: \nUFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent, Category = “MyActor”) \nvoid OnMyEvent();\n };\n</code></pre><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this example, <code><strong>OnMyEvent</strong></code> is a virtual function that can be overridden in Blueprint. To override the function in Blueprint, you simply create a new Blueprint based on <code><strong>MyActor</strong></code> and add a new implementation of the <code><strong>OnMyEvent</strong></code> function.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Use Visual Studio Code Analysis</h2><p>Visual Studio Code Analysis is a tool provided by Microsoft that can help identify potential bugs and performance issues in your C++ code. In Unreal Engine, you can use Code Analysis to analyze your code for potential issues and improve code quality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Code Analysis works by analyzing your code for potential issues such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and resource leaks. It then provides warnings and suggestions for how to fix these issues, making it easier to write code that is more reliable and efficient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Wrapping up</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Writing clean and efficient C++ code is essential for creating high-quality games in Unreal Engine. By following these best practices, you can write code that is easy to read, maintain, and optimize, and avoid common errors and pitfalls that can lead to bugs and performance issues. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting out with Unreal Engine, these tips can help you write better code and create better games.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Learning how to write clean and efficient C++ code for Unreal Engine can be a challenging task, but there are many online courses and resources available that can help you master these skills.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Here are some recommendations for online courses that can help you:</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Udemy - Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games</strong></li></ol><p>This course is designed for beginners who want to learn how to use C++ to create games in Unreal Engine.
