The signs of a looming recession are evident, with rising interest rates, inverted treasury yield curves, and predictions of unemployment levels increasing to 6.5%. But while recessions can be daunting, they don’t have to be the end of the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a finance degree holder and a qualified accountant, I’ve got some strategies that will help you prepare for the tough times ahead. <strong>Here are six things you can start doing today to make sure you are well-prepared for the coming months.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Avoid Toxic Lending</h2><p>With interest rates on the rise, borrowing money has become more expensive than ever. Paying down your existing debts or loans is, therefore, crucial. By doing so, you’ll be saving on the interest that you would have had to pay otherwise, and getting a guaranteed return on your investment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Top Up Your Stockpile</h2><p>Recessions come with a rise in unemployment rates, and statistics show that we’re expecting it to reach 6.5%. It’s vital to have an emergency fund, or what I like to call a stockpile, to fall back on if you lose your job or have an emergency. The money should be kept in a high-interest savings account, easily accessible, and not tied up in the stock market or property. For employed people, a recommended sum is three to six months’ worth of basic living expenses. Self-employed individuals, on the other hand, should have six months’ worth of both living expenses and business expenses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Don’t Crystallize</h2><p>When the stock market drops, many people panic and start selling. This move is counterproductive as it crystallizes your losses and removes any chance of recovering your money when the market eventually bounces back. Keep in mind that historical charts show that the market has always recovered after major crashes. The general trend of the stock market is an upward trajectory, and it’s all about time in the market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Start Investing</h2><p>Most fortunes are made during a recession, and the same goes for the stock market. This is the time to invest, not shy away from it. If you’ve been hesitant to invest in the past, now is the time to dive in. High-quality stocks will be cheaper than ever, and by systematically investing over time, you’re in a great position to reap the rewards in the future. This financial strategy is called dollar-cost averaging or pound-cost averaging, and it means investing smaller amounts in the stock market over time, instead of a lump sum at once.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Consider Alternative Sources of Income</h2><p>The pandemic has shown us that having a side hustle or a passive income stream can be beneficial, especially during tough times. If you’re not sure where to start, consider your skills and passions, and see how you can monetize them. You could start a blog, offer consulting services, or sell products online. The possibilities are endless, and with the internet, it’s easier than ever to start a business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Focus on Your Mental Health</h2><p>Recessions can be stressful, and it’s essential to take care of your mental health during these times. Make sure you’re getting enough sleep, exercise, and eating well. Talk to friends and family about your worries, and seek professional help if needed. Remember, your mental well-being is just as important as your financial well-being.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In conclusion,</strong> preparing for a recession is crucial in order to weather the storm and come out on the other side with your finances intact. Some of the strategies discussed in this article include avoiding toxic lending, building up an emergency fund, not panicking and selling investments during a market downturn, and taking advantage of investment opportunities during a recession. By implementing these strategies, you can increase your financial resilience and protect yourself from the negative impacts of a recession.</p>"}}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
