As businesses have shifted online, the need for web development professionals has skyrocketed. If you’re someone who is interested in web development and wants to build a career in this field, then you’re in the right place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>In this article, we will share a beginner-friendly guide on how to become a web developer in 2023.</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install Linux</strong></p><p>The first step to becoming a web developer is to install a version of Linux on your machine. Linux is a popular operating system among developers, and most developers use it as their primary operating system. It’s open-source, free, and has a vast community of developers who create software and tools for it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are many versions of Linux available, but if you’re a beginner, we recommend starting with Ubuntu. It’s easy to use, has a user-friendly interface, and is perfect for beginners. You can find tutorials online on how to install Ubuntu on your machine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 2: Get Comfortable with an IDE</strong></p><p>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that helps developers write and manage code. If you’re a beginner, we recommend starting with a basic IDE like Visual Studio Code or WebStorm. These IDEs are easy to use and have many features that will help you write code efficiently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re already comfortable with a basic IDE, we recommend trying a more advanced one like Vim or Emacs. These IDEs have a learning curve, but they offer many benefits once you’re comfortable using them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 3: Learn a Programming Language</strong></p><p>The next step is to learn a programming language. There are many programming languages to choose from, but if you’re a beginner, we recommend starting with either <strong>JavaScript</strong> or <strong>Python</strong>. Both languages are easy to learn and widely used in web development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JavaScript is a scripting language used to create interactive web pages. It’s used on the client-side and server-side and is an essential skill for web developers. Python is a general-purpose language used in various applications, including web development. It’s known for its readability and simplicity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 4: Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong></p><p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the building blocks of web development. HTML is used to structure web pages, CSS is used to style web pages, and JavaScript is used to add interactivity to web pages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Learning these three languages is essential for becoming a web developer. You can find many online resources and tutorials to help you learn these languages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 5: Build Projects</strong></p><p>Building projects is an excellent way to apply what you’ve learned and gain practical experience. Start with simple projects and gradually move on to more complex ones. You can build projects like a portfolio website, a weather app, or a simple game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Building projects will help you improve your skills, learn new technologies, and build a portfolio that you can showcase to potential employers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 6: Network and Find a Job</strong></p><p>Networking is crucial in any industry, and web development is no exception. Attend meetups, conferences, and events to meet other developers and learn about the latest trends and technologies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can also find job opportunities through networking. Many companies prefer to hire developers through referrals, so having a strong network can increase your chances of finding a job.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Becoming a web developer is a rewarding and challenging career. It requires dedication, hard work, and continuous learning. By following these six steps, you can start your journey towards becoming a web developer in 2023. Remember to take your time, practice, and have fun while learning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Here are some online courses related to web development that I would recommend:</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>The Complete Web Developer Course - Udemy</strong></p><p>This course is designed for beginners and covers a wide range of topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and more.
