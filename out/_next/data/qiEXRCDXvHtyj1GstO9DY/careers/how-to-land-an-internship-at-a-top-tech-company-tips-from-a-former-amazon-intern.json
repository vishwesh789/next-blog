But with so many applicants vying for limited spots, how can you stand out from the crowd and secure that coveted internship?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>In this article, we’ll take a look at some tips and insights from a former Amazon intern on how to land an internship at a top tech company.</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Preparing for the Prescreening Process</strong></p><p>Before you can even interview for an internship at a top tech company, you’ll likely need to pass a prescreening process, which may include algorithmic questions and criteria based on your GPA and field of study. While some aspects of the prescreening process may be out of your control, such as your GPA, you can definitely improve your chances by sharpening your technical skills, particularly in data structures and algorithms. To prepare for the technical interview, it’s recommended that you practice with online coding problems, such as those found on LeetCode.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Nailing the Technical Interview</h2><p>Once you’ve made it past the prescreening process, the next step is the technical interview. According to the former Amazon intern, the first two interviews for Amazon were coding problems that had to be solved on paper in front of an interviewer. These problems were taken from LeetCode, so it’s important to have practiced with these types of problems beforehand. In addition to algorithmic questions, Amazon also asked DBMS and OS-related questions, which the intern did not encounter in other big tech companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While every company’s interview process may differ, it’s important to be mentally prepared to give multiple interviews on the same day, and to stay calm and focused during the process. If you’re unsure of a question or need clarification, don’t be afraid to ask the interviewer for help. And remember, the interview isn’t just about getting the right answer - it’s also about demonstrating your problem-solving skills and ability to think critically under pressure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Making the Most of Your Internship</h2><p>Once you’ve secured an internship at a top tech company, it’s important to make the most of the opportunity. Depending on the team you’re assigned to, the work can be either intense or relatively chill. If you find yourself with extra downtime, it’s your responsibility as an intern to seek out additional projects and tasks to keep yourself busy and show your value to the team.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to your main internship, you may also have the opportunity to pursue other projects or internships simultaneously. While it’s admirable to want to take on multiple opportunities, it’s important to be realistic about your time and energy, and to prioritize your main internship first. The former Amazon intern worked on a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) internship simultaneously with his Amazon internship, which added extra workload but ultimately paid off in terms of building his resume and experience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Securing a Full-Time Job Offer</h2><p>While not all internships lead to full-time job offers, securing a pre-placement offer (PPO) can be a great way to ensure job security post-graduation. Unfortunately, the former Amazon intern did not receive a PPO offer, which he attributes to not being assigned enough work during his internship. To avoid this, it’s important to stay proactive and seek out additional projects and responsibilities throughout your internship. Even if you don’t receive a PPO offer, your internship experience can still be valuable in terms of building your skills, network, and resume.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In conclusion,</strong> getting an internship at a big tech company like Amazon can be a great way to kickstart your career, especially if you’re in college. While there are some factors that are out of your control, such as the prescreening process and the companies that visit your campus, there are things you can do to improve your chances, such as practicing your technical skills and focusing on companies that you’re interested in. Once you get the internship, the work can vary depending on the team you’re in, but it’s important to make the most of the opportunity and try to get involved in meaningful projects. And even if you don’t get a pre-placement offer, it’s still a valuable experience that can help you in your future job search.</p>"}}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
