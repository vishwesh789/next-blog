However, waiting until you’re 65 to enjoy your life doesn’t sound too appealing to most people. The good news is that there are four ways to plan for retirement, and one of them may be the key to retiring sooner and living the life you desire.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The first method is traditional retirement.</strong></h2><p>This method involves going to work for about 40 years and then transitioning to a life you want at age 65. You save up enough money and have a retirement plan in place to cover your living expenses. However, waiting until you’re 65 to start living the life you want is not the best option for everyone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The second method is the Times 25 Rule.</h2><p>This rule challenges the traditional notion of retirement by aiming to achieve financial independence at a much younger age, typically in your 40s or even 30s. The idea is to save and invest enough so that you can live off your passive income without spending the majority of your life working and relying on traditional employment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The first step to the Times 25 Rule</strong> is calculating your Financial Freedom number, which is the amount you’d be happy to earn every single year. When calculating this number, include everything you’d want and need to spend on if you stopped working today. Then, multiply that number by 25, and this number gives you a rough estimate of how much money you should save and invest to be able to retire today. For example, if you calculate all your expenses and spending and that comes to $40,000, then you would need to invest $1 million for your retirement. The idea behind this is that if you only take out 4% in the first year, i.e., the $40,000 that we calculated earlier and then adjust it for inflation in the subsequent years, you should have enough money to last for 30 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The study that this analysis is based on assumed a portfolio of a 50-50 stock to bond ratio with a 96% success rate that your portfolio stays intact over the next 30 years. This early retirement number involves saving and investing a lot of money now so you can eventually live off it. The more you can earn and the higher your savings rate, and the more frugal you can be, the quicker you can get to that early retirement number.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If the Times 25 Rule is not your plan, and you want more options and freedom, then the third method of retirement may be more relevant to you. This method is the concept of mini-retirement, which is a lifestyle in which you can take retirement concept and embed it periodically into your life from now. It’s not about permanently leaving the workforce, like traditional retirement or the Times 25 Rule. Instead, mini-retirements are a series of intentional breaks throughout your career to pursue personal passions, travel, or do something you want to do without completely stepping out of the workforce.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With this method, you don’t need a large nest egg or the $1 million that we spoke about earlier to be able to do this. But before taking that plunge and drafting your resignation letter, you do need to have a plan in place and have saved up enough to be able to step out of working life for a period of time. It’s also not an option for everyone. People who are just sick of work and don’t like what they do may not really benefit from the mini retirement because it’s not solving that issue. And you still need to have a strategic plan for getting back to work after your time off.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The fourth option is eternal retirement, and it’s essentially to embed the concept of retirement into your lifestyle today. For the majority of us, retirement isn’t about doing nothing at all. Instead, it’s about having the time to do things that we really enjoy and money not necessarily being an issue. And as Naval Ravikant once said, “Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imagining tomorrow.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, when today is complete in and of itself, you’re retired. And that retirement is not about stopping work altogether, but instead doing what you love so that you don’t even feel like you’re working, and you’re actually doing what you would have anyway if you were retired.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The way I like to think about this is, if you’re doing something that you’d be happy to do for free, then you’re essentially retired. And there’s no need to wait until you’re 65 or have saved up a million dollars to start living your life the way you want to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, the question is, how do we achieve this eternal retirement? The first step is to identify what you really love doing and what brings you joy. It could be anything from painting, writing, traveling, cooking, or volunteering. Once you’ve identified what that is, you can start incorporating it into your life in a way that works for you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It could be as simple as dedicating a few hours each week to your passion, or it could be something more drastic, like quitting your job and pursuing your passion full time. The key is to make sure that your passion is sustainable and can support your lifestyle in the long run.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another important aspect of eternal retirement is financial planning. While you don’t necessarily need a million dollars to achieve this type of retirement, you do need to make sure that your passion can support your lifestyle. This means setting financial goals and creating a budget that works for you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One way to do this is to calculate your Financial Freedom number, just like in the Times 25 Rule, but instead of aiming to save a million dollars, you calculate how much money you need to sustain your lifestyle while pursuing your passion. This will help you plan and save accordingly, so you can achieve eternal retirement and do what you love without financial stress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In conclusion,</strong> retirement doesn’t have to be a far-off dream that we only start living after decades of work. There are multiple ways to achieve retirement, whether it’s through traditional retirement, the Times 25 Rule, mini retirements, or eternal retirement. The key is to identify what you really want and start planning for it today. Whether you want to retire in your 40s or embed retirement into your lifestyle, it’s never too early or too late to start planning for your dream retirement.</p>"}}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
