It is a time when you may feel like you have finally gotten a hold of your life and have everything in place. However, it is also a time to start taking your finances seriously as the decisions you make now can have a ripple effect on your future. With this in mind, it is important to set financial goals that will help set you up for the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In this article,</strong> <strong>we will discuss six financial goals that you should focus on in your 30s.</strong> These goals will not only help you secure your future financially but also allow you to enjoy your present life without any financial stress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><strong>Focus on Your Career Capital</strong></p><p>The first goal you want to focus on is your career capital. According to Cal Newport in his book, Be So Good They Can’t Ignore You, career capital is defined as skills you have that are both rare and valuable. These skills can be used as leverage in defining your career. While your 20s may have been all about exploring and trying new things, failing fast, and failing forward, your 30s are about doubling down on what you enjoy and what can give you the most leverage in terms of pay and reward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>A lot of people focus on passive income and trying to grow their passive income straight away. While that is important to get the ball rolling, active income is more important when you’re just starting out. Active income at the start is your primary wealth-building tool, and the money you make from it is going to dictate how quickly you can grow your other income streams.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol start=\"2\"><li><p><strong>Build a Mortality Fund</strong></p><p>As you enter your 30s, a lot of responsibilities come all at once. You may have kids, a mortgage, and other bills to keep on top of. We generally don’t have as much flexibility and options as we did in our early 20s. If something unexpected happens, whether it’s healthcare or a job loss, the last thing you want is the additional financial stress of not having enough money to pay for it. This is why building a mortality fund is crucial.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>This needs to be liquid cash in a high-interest savings account, not locked up anywhere, just easily accessible. I personally keep six months of my living expenses in my emergency fund at any one time, and I never touch it. I leave it in a separate account, a high-interest savings account, so I’m at least earning interest whilst it’s sitting there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol start=\"3\"><li><p><strong>Measure Your Money</strong></p><p>People who are good with their finances and managing their money measure their money. By clearly knowing what their long-term saving goals are and how they are working towards them, they don’t aimlessly spend without any clear motive on how much they want to save or spend. If you go off track from your overall saving goals, it will be tough to save up for anything substantial. Therefore, measuring your money is critical.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>Go through your personal finance tracker every three months. Sit down with all your bills, debit cards, or credit cards, and consolidate everything into your personal finance tracker. This will give you a clear idea of all your earnings and outgoings and a snapshot of how you are doing at any given time. You can use any tracker that works for you, but the idea is to get a clear idea of where most of your money is going and how you can cut back in areas that aren’t as important to you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol start=\"4\"><li><p><strong>Diversify your investments</strong></p><p>It’s important to spread your investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, as well as different geographic regions and industries. This way, if one asset class or region experiences a downturn, your overall portfolio won’t be as severely affected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also important to regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that your investments are still aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals. This may involve selling off assets that have become too risky or investing in new opportunities that have emerged.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Plan for retirement</strong></p><p>It’s never too early to start thinking about retirement and how you will support yourself in your later years. One of the most powerful tools for retirement planning is compound interest. The earlier you start investing for retirement, the more time your money has to grow and compound.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Consider opening a tax-advantaged retirement account, such as an IRA or 401(k), and contribute as much as you can afford. Many employers offer matching contributions to their employees’ retirement accounts, so be sure to take advantage of this if it’s available to you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should also have a clear idea of what your retirement goals are and how much money you will need to achieve them. Use retirement calculators and speak with a financial advisor to help you plan for retirement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Protect your assets</strong></p><p>As you accumulate wealth and assets, it’s important to protect them from potential risks, such as lawsuits or unexpected events. Consider obtaining adequate insurance coverage, such as liability insurance, homeowners insurance, and life insurance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may also want to consider setting up a trust or creating a will to ensure that your assets are distributed according to your wishes. Speaking with an estate planning attorney can help you determine the best strategies for protecting your assets and your family’s financial future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In conclusion,</strong> setting financial goals in your 30s can have a significant impact on your financial future. By focusing on career capital, building an emergency fund, measuring and managing your money, diversifying your investments, planning for retirement, and protecting your assets, you can set yourself up for long-term financial success.</p></li></ol>"}}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
