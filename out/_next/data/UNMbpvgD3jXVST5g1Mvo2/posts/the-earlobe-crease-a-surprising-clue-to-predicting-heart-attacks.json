While there are many tests and indicators used to predict heart disease risk, one of the most surprising indicators is the appearance of your earlobe.\n\nAccording to recent research, a crease in the bottom of your earlobe that starts from the hole and runs at a 45-degree angle could be an indicator of heart disease. In fact, this crease is found in about 71% of people with coronary artery disease.\n\nThe reason for this is that the earlobe is part of the peripheral body, and a lack of blood flow to the tiny capillaries in this area can lead to the loss of elastin, connective tissue, and cartilage, causing it to wrinkle and form the crease.\n\nWhen blood flow to the heart is obstructed, the body can lose collateral circulation, which are extra arteries that serve as a plan B for blood supply to the heart muscle. This chronic lack of blood flow can lead to a loss of circulation in the peripheral parts of the body, including the earlobe, and can cause the crease to appear.\n\nWhile a crease in the earlobe is not a definitive sign of heart disease, it is worth paying attention to, especially since the first symptom of a heart attack in over 50% of cases is death. Early detection of heart disease is crucial, and the presence of the earlobe crease could be a clue that something is not right.\n\nSo, what can you do if you have a crease in your earlobe? \n\nThere are several steps you can take to reduce your risk of heart disease and improve your heart health.\n\nAdopt a Healthy Diet\n\nThe first step is to adopt a healthy diet, specifically the healthy version of the ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting. This type of diet has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of heart disease, as well as improving other health markers like blood sugar control and weight loss.\n\nExercise Regularly\n\nExercise is also crucial for heart health, and a regular exercise routine can help flood the body with more oxygen, including the heart muscle. Consistency is key, and it’s important to maintain an exercise routine for the rest of your life.\n\nTake Vitamin E and Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n\nTaking supplements like tocotrienols, a type of vitamin E, and cod liver oil, a source of omega-3 fatty acids, can also be beneficial for heart health. Tocotrienols are a potent antioxidant that can drive oxygen to the heart muscle and protect the vascular system, while cod liver oil contains vitamin A and D, which are important for heart health.\n\nTake Vitamin K2\n\nLastly, taking vitamin K2 with vitamin D3 can help keep calcium from building up in the arteries, reducing the risk of heart disease.\n\nIn conclusion, while a crease in the earlobe is not a definitive sign of heart disease, it can serve as an important indicator to pay attention to. By adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and taking supplements like tocotrienols, cod liver oil, and vitamin K2 with vitamin D3, you can reduce your risk of heart disease and improve your overall heart health. Remember, prevention is key, and early detection can save lives.","tags":["heart attack"],"readTime":4,"dataSources":["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5338988/","https://academic.oup.com/omcr/article/2021/9/omab089/6372553?login=false"],"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Health","slug":"health","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-25T00:14:43.861Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}},"body":{"id":100,"content":"<p data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\"><strong>Heart disease</strong> is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection of the condition can save lives.
