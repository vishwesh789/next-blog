My lab and other laboratories have been very interested in developing tools that allow us to push back on stress. \nFeel more calm in real time, meaning without having to disengage from the stress-inducing activity. The best way that I am aware of doing that is called the physiological sigh. A physiological sigh is a pattern of breathing that involves two inhales followed by an extended exhale. \nPhysiological sighs were discovered in the 1930s as a pattern of breathing that people go into spontaneously when they are in claustrophobic environments or in deep sleep. When there's a buildup of a gas called carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, carbon dioxide triggers the impulse to breathe. \nThere are neurons in the brain that know when carbon dioxide levels have gotten too high.

And typically the first inhale is longer than the second, but the second one is still important to do, and then a very long extended exhale. \nTypically, both inhales are through the nose and the exhale is through the mouth. That's the most effective way to do the physiological side. However, if you can't breathe through your nose or your mouth, for whatever reason, do it throughout your mouth or throughout your nose. \nThe second inhale is really important because your lungs are not just two big bags of air.

So when you do the double inhale, it re-inflates any of these little sacks that have collapsed, and in doing so, it allows you to offload more carbon dioxide. \nSo if you're feeling stressed in any circumstance, inhale twice through the nose and then exhale long through the mouth. You can repeat it a second or even a third time.

It turns out you can do this using physiology and neuroscience. Your breathing can directly impact your heart rate and your level of stress, or calm. \n\nHere’s how it’s works. When you inhale, your diaphragm moves down. This creates more space in your thoracic cavity, and your heart actually gets a little bigger. As a result, the rate of blood flow through that larger heart volume slows down. \n\nA signal is sent from a group of neurons on your heart called the sinoatrial node. That signal goes up to the brain, and your brain sends a signal to speed the heart up. In other words, inhaling speeds your heart rate up. \n\nThe opposite is true as well. When you exhale, your diaphragm moves up, your heart gets a little bit smaller because there’s a little bit less space in your thoracic cavity. As a result, blood flows more quickly through that smaller volume. \n\nThe sinoatrial node registers that and signals your brain, and the brain signals to slow the heart down. So, in other words, inhaling speeds your heart rate up. Exhaling slows your heart rate down. \n\nSo if you want to speed up your heart rate and be more alert, inhale more or make those inhales more vigorous, more intense, if you want to calm down, you can do that quickly by making your exhales slightly longer than your inhales or making them more vigorous. \n\nThis doesn’t require any breath work. This is something that you can do in real time, and that’s what’s called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. That’s the technical phrase. It’s also the basis of what’s called heart rate variability, or HRV. \n\nBut all you need to remember is inhaling deeper and longer will speed your heart rate up. Exhaling. Longer and more intensely will slow your heart rate down and will allow you to calm down in real time. ","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":2}},{"id":9,"attributes":{"title":"7 Health Benefits of Green Tea & How to Drink it ","slug":"7-health-benefits-of-green-tea-and-how-to-drink-it","createdAt":"2023-02-03T00:43:29.954Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-04T22:20:38.583Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-03T00:43:32.258Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1417945/pexels-photo-1417945.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"This article is going to be all about the health benefits of green tea. I’ve seen some overblown claims, so we’re going to parse through and figure out what’s what. Also, read till the end of the article to get tips on how to make the healthiest cup of tea possible. \n\nTea is one of those rare beverages that’s pretty much universally accepted by science as a healthy one. But just remember. As with everything in. Life, you can have too much of a good thing. So don’t overdo it with the green tea. \n\nThe number one thing that makes green tea so good for you is that it’s loaded with healthy nutrients. All of these bioactive polyphenols are awesome for your health. You may have heard of some of them known as flavonoids or catechins. \n\nAnd what those are just antioxidants. What antioxidants do is prevent free radical damage to your body, and free radical damage to your body over time causes cancer. But let me break that down a bit. \n\nI know all of you have faucets at home, whether it’s in your bathroom or in your kitchen. Some of those faucets have rust on them. The rust is a direct result of that free radical damage we always talk about. \n\nNow, antioxidants prevent that rust from forming. So think of antioxidants as the rust prevention within our own bodies. Within media, it’s been mentioned before that those who drink green tea have lower rates of cancer, and it’s been theorized that it has something to do with the huge amount of antioxidants found within green tea. \n\nWe have to not get too excited by this fact, because this is only a correlation and not a causation. Yes, it’s good to drink green tea, but no, it’s not going to cure and prevent all types of cancer. \n\nSecond significant point about green tea, if you got stinky breath, maybe you should try some green tea. The nutrients within green tea that we just mentioned on this last point, known as catechins, do a great job of inhibiting and killing certain types of bacteria. \n\nIn fact, studies were done and proved that bacteria known to cause bad breath within your mouth was killed by drinking green tea. Also, when you have less of that specific bacteria, you have less plaque. So green tea also decreases the risk of developing a cavity.\n\n Point three about green tea. It does a great job of giving you stable energy without all the jitters. It has about 30 to 50 milligrams of caffeine, which is roughly half a cup of coffee. \n\nYou’re still focused, you’re still stimulated, but you don’t have that jittery feeling that you get yet with a big cup of coffee. Another nutrient within green tea that works together with caffeine to boost your brain function is called Althea. \n\nIts benefit is that it gives your brain relaxation without the added sedation or drowsiness that comes along with other relaxing agents. While we’ve seen in animal and lab models, it increases your good cholesterol and lowers your bad cholesterol, what we found in animal lab and human trials is that green tea lowers your blood pressure. \n\n Point number five: green tea can help you burn fat. Well, this is more of an individual case-by-case basis thing, because not all studies agree on this. \n\nBut there is a promise of increased metabolism and fat oxidation, essentially fat burning. Some of the lab models have shown a decrease in new blood vessel formation within your fat stores, meaning that it literally takes away the vital nutrition for your fat and makes it die. \n\nPoint number six: Animal and lab models both show that catechins the nutrient we keep mentioning repeatedly decrease the risk of you developing Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Science isn’t clear on why this occurs, but it’s theorized that it has something to do with the decrease in the development of plaque within the brain. If that doesn’t encourage you to take a sip, I don’t know what will.\n\nPoint 7: Now, this is the game changer. This is the one that everyone gets excited about. Green tea may increase your lifespan. There’s been a ton of research done on this. \n\nSome studies even have 40,000 participants that show those who drink three to five cups of tea a day have an increased lifespan, have a decreased all, cause mortality. That means dying from anything, has decreases in heart disease, decreases in strokes. \n\nBut before we get too excited, we need to remember correlation versus causation. Just because those who drink green tea live longer, it doesn’t mean green tea is the sole thing that’s responsible for that effect. \n\nSo, yes, enjoy your green tea, but don’t think you’re going to live forever. Here’s how you create the healthiest cup of tea possible. Don’t add green tea directly to boiling water as it destroys those healthy categories we’ve been talking about. \n\nDon’t go decaf because the decaffeination process hurts more of the nutrients found in green tea. Add lemon into your tea as it aid in the absorption of some of these nutrients.  ","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":5}},{"id":10,"attributes":{"title":"Intermittent Fasting: Pros and cons","slug":"intermittent-fasting-pros-and-cons","createdAt":"2023-02-03T01:44:22.565Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-04T22:21:40.761Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-03T01:52:01.953Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/70497/pexels-photo-70497.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Our bodies enter a fasting state every time we’re asleep. Some people do intermittent fasting and do not even know it. I mean, there’s plenty of times where I had a stressful rotation in medical school or a difficult job in the hospital where I didn’t have time to eat breakfast. \n\nThat’s a form of intermittent fasting. And our bodies are totally capable of handling this. I know what you’re thinking. I don’t want to starve myself for health benefits. Intermittent fasting is not starving. \n\nWhen you’re fasting, your body is using stored nutrients and stored energy forms in order to make your body continue to function. When you’re starving, you run out of those energy sources and are breaking down vital tissues like organs to get that same energy. \n\nThere are many different ways to go about going on one of these diets. And that not only makes it confusing for you, but that also makes it very difficult to do research on it to find out how effective it truly is. \n\nBecause if there are multiple ways to do it, we have to be able to test each one of those ways. The 16/8 diet which is not eating during 16 hours of the day. Alternate day fasting, where you eat one day fast, the other day five and two were two days of the week that you’re fasting. \n\nThere’s no hard and fast rule saying that this is the correct way of doing it. You may be wondering how is IF beneficial to me? There’s been a lot of proposed health benefits. Many of them have been proven within animal studies or lab models, which is not the same thing as being proven in a human model, but they are very promising. \n\nNow, those benefits include increased mental sharpness, a favorable hormonal profile, weight loss. Decreases of inflammation within the body, decreases of certain diseases within the body. How can IF help you lose weight? \n\nYou have an increase in growth hormone, a decrease in insulin, and that alone will help you lose weight. Next, because you’re skipping meals or even going days without eating meals, it’s very likely that when you look throughout the week, you’ll be eating fewer calories. \n\nOur thinking is that during 8 hours you’ll eat less than you would if you were eating during 16 hours. Let’s talk about these other health benefits. We know that chronic stress is not good for the body. \n\nThe body is just not meant to be chronically stressed out. It’s not meant to have a high heart rate, high blood pressure. Intermittent fasting is really a form of acute short term mild stress. This type of acute short term stress is really good for the body. \n\nWhat can we use as a metaphor here? Let’s take exercise. Exercise is a form of acute mild stress. What happens after exercise? We have benefits for the brain. We have benefits for weight loss. We have benefits for disease prevention. \n\nNow, similarly, when you stress your body through intermittent fasting, there are some benefits. More autophagy, which is the removal of cellular waste, more production of neurotrophic factors, which protect your brain, and a favorable hormonal profile with increases in human growth hormone and norepinephrine. \n\nLet’s talk about some of the shortcomings of IF. Primarily, there’s not enough guidance on what you should eat. We don’t know how many calories. We don’t know what foods to eat on the days or times that you actually are eating. \n\nSecond, we don’t know which form of IF is best. Third, there are some side effects when you are fasting that people do experience heading aches, mental fog, heartburn. These things do exist. It’s not totally benign. \n\nFour. We don’t know the consequences of following an intermittent fasting diet long term. Most, if not all, of these studies are done on the short term. If you are eating a very unhealthy diet and then make a change, you’re definitely going to see a benefit. ","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":4}},{"id":11,"attributes":{"title":"I went VEGAN For 30 Days | Here's How My Body Reacted...","slug":"i-went-vegan-for-30-days-here-s-how-my-body-reacted","createdAt":"2023-02-03T04:11:22.897Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-04T22:44:53.809Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-03T04:11:25.351Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1351238/pexels-photo-1351238.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Honestly, I was really proud of myself, and it’s nice every now and then to take a challenge like this and learn something new about yourself.  \nFive things I Learned to be vegan for 30 days ...\nIn fact, I want to tell you five things that I learned not only about the vegan diet but also about myself during this process. One, when I didn’t plan well; I ate very unhealthy when I was at MIT for breakfast. I ate cinnamon toast Crunch with almond milk and a banana every morning. That’s not healthy, even though it’s vegan. \nTwo, I didn’t notice a major change in my energy level like I thought I would. I mean, maybe I had a slightly decreased energy level, but we remember I was sick in the beginning. I was under eating calories, so I don’t feel it’s fair to blame vegan for that. \n\nThree, surprisingly, I didn’t get weaker on vegan. I was lifting strong, and I felt good. But what suffered was getting to the gym. I really noticed the lack of willpower when I was following the restrictive diet. \nFour, when it comes to my body, I lost 3 pound. I dropped from 203 to 200 pounds. So there was some weight loss, probably from under-eating calories, but despite losing weight, I didn’t feel as lean. I mean, all those sauces, all the rice that I ate, pasta that contributed to the car bloat and probably made me feel a little bit pudgier than usual. \nFive, this is the big one. The real difficulty was my GI system. I mean, it was a mess. The amount of gas and flatulence and bloating. God, I can’t. It’s, like, gross even talking about, but it was terrible. \n\nIf you have that with any diet, there’s no way you’re sticking with it. And I tried taking some over-the-counter supplements for this. It did absolutely nothing.\n\nMy advice to you .....\nIf you’re curious or interested in starting a vegan diet, I don’t want to dissuade you. In fact, I want to encourage you. Go talk to a dietitian nutritionist physician, someone who’s well versed in vegan diets. That way you could do it the healthy, happy, safe way without hurting yourself in the process. \nAnd please reduce the amount of refined carbs and processed foods that you’re eating, because as more research comes out, that’s the stuff that causes diseases and shortens your lifespan. And as always, stay happy and healthy. ","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":10}},{"id":12,"attributes":{"title":"Real Cause of Chronic Kidney Disease and Polycystic Kidney Disease","slug":"real-cause-of-chronic-kidney-disease-and-polycystic-kidney-disease","createdAt":"2023-02-04T13:26:37.597Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-04T22:47:22.212Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-04T13:27:07.778Z","img":"https://advancedurology.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kidney-Stone-Signs-scaled.jpg","metaDesc":"Chronic kidney disease is mainly made up of several types of problems with the kidney.

Oxalates are things that contribute to kidney stones, and they’re in spinach, the almonds, the chocolate, kiwi.\nMetformin has to do with regulating blood sugar by improving insulin resistance, another interesting association.

But typically, just one or two, maybe three physiological sighs are sufficient to bring your level of stress and alertness down very fast and allow you to feel more calm. ","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":3,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Lifestyle","slug":"lifestyle","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T18:56:54.291Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":8,"attributes":{"title":"How to Control Stress in Real-Time","slug":"how-to-control-stress-in-real-time","createdAt":"2023-02-02T14:08:24.693Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-04T22:20:59.991Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-02T16:13:02.774Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/321576/pexels-photo-321576.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"An ability to control your levels of stress in real time is extremely powerful. It turns out you can do this using physiology and neuroscience. Your breathing can directly impact your heart rate and your level of stress, or calm. \n\nHere’s how it’s works. When you inhale, your diaphragm moves down. This creates more space in your thoracic cavity, and your heart actually gets a little bigger. As a result, the rate of blood flow through that larger heart volume slows down. \n\nA signal is sent from a group of neurons on your heart called the sinoatrial node. That signal goes up to the brain, and your brain sends a signal to speed the heart up. In other words, inhaling speeds your heart rate up. \n\nThe opposite is true as well. When you exhale, your diaphragm moves up, your heart gets a little bit smaller because there’s a little bit less space in your thoracic cavity. As a result, blood flows more quickly through that smaller volume. \n\nThe sinoatrial node registers that and signals your brain, and the brain signals to slow the heart down. So, in other words, inhaling speeds your heart rate up. Exhaling slows your heart rate down. \n\nSo if you want to speed up your heart rate and be more alert, inhale more or make those inhales more vigorous, more intense, if you want to calm down, you can do that quickly by making your exhales slightly longer than your inhales or making them more vigorous. \n\nThis doesn’t require any breath work. This is something that you can do in real time, and that’s what’s called respiratory sinus arrhythmia. That’s the technical phrase. It’s also the basis of what’s called heart rate variability, or HRV. \n\nBut all you need to remember is inhaling deeper and longer will speed your heart rate up. Exhaling. Longer and more intensely will slow your heart rate down and will allow you to calm down in real time. ","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":2,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Lifestyle","slug":"lifestyle","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T18:56:54.291Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":9,"attributes":{"title":"7 Health Benefits of Green Tea & How to Drink it ","slug":"7-health-benefits-of-green-tea-and-how-to-drink-it","createdAt":"2023-02-03T00:43:29.954Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-04T22:20:38.583Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-03T00:43:32.258Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1417945/pexels-photo-1417945.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"This article is going to be all about the health benefits of green tea. I’ve seen some overblown claims, so we’re going to parse through and figure out what’s what. Also, read till the end of the article to get tips on how to make the healthiest cup of tea possible. \n\nTea is one of those rare beverages that’s pretty much universally accepted by science as a healthy one. But just remember. As with everything in. Life, you can have too much of a good thing. So don’t overdo it with the green tea. \n\nThe number one thing that makes green tea so good for you is that it’s loaded with healthy nutrients. All of these bioactive polyphenols are awesome for your health. You may have heard of some of them known as flavonoids or catechins. \n\nAnd what those are just antioxidants. What antioxidants do is prevent free radical damage to your body, and free radical damage to your body over time causes cancer. But let me break that down a bit. \n\nI know all of you have faucets at home, whether it’s in your bathroom or in your kitchen. Some of those faucets have rust on them. The rust is a direct result of that free radical damage we always talk about. \n\nNow, antioxidants prevent that rust from forming. So think of antioxidants as the rust prevention within our own bodies. Within media, it’s been mentioned before that those who drink green tea have lower rates of cancer, and it’s been theorized that it has something to do with the huge amount of antioxidants found within green tea. \n\nWe have to not get too excited by this fact, because this is only a correlation and not a causation. Yes, it’s good to drink green tea, but no, it’s not going to cure and prevent all types of cancer. \n\nSecond significant point about green tea, if you got stinky breath, maybe you should try some green tea. The nutrients within green tea that we just mentioned on this last point, known as catechins, do a great job of inhibiting and killing certain types of bacteria. \n\nIn fact, studies were done and proved that bacteria known to cause bad breath within your mouth was killed by drinking green tea. Also, when you have less of that specific bacteria, you have less plaque. So green tea also decreases the risk of developing a cavity.\n\n Point three about green tea. It does a great job of giving you stable energy without all the jitters. It has about 30 to 50 milligrams of caffeine, which is roughly half a cup of coffee. \n\nYou’re still focused, you’re still stimulated, but you don’t have that jittery feeling that you get yet with a big cup of coffee. Another nutrient within green tea that works together with caffeine to boost your brain function is called Althea. \n\nIts benefit is that it gives your brain relaxation without the added sedation or drowsiness that comes along with other relaxing agents. While we’ve seen in animal and lab models, it increases your good cholesterol and lowers your bad cholesterol, what we found in animal lab and human trials is that green tea lowers your blood pressure. \n\n Point number five: green tea can help you burn fat. Well, this is more of an individual case-by-case basis thing, because not all studies agree on this. \n\nBut there is a promise of increased metabolism and fat oxidation, essentially fat burning. Some of the lab models have shown a decrease in new blood vessel formation within your fat stores, meaning that it literally takes away the vital nutrition for your fat and makes it die. \n\nPoint number six: Animal and lab models both show that catechins the nutrient we keep mentioning repeatedly decrease the risk of you developing Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Science isn’t clear on why this occurs, but it’s theorized that it has something to do with the decrease in the development of plaque within the brain. If that doesn’t encourage you to take a sip, I don’t know what will.\n\nPoint 7: Now, this is the game changer. This is the one that everyone gets excited about. Green tea may increase your lifespan. There’s been a ton of research done on this. \n\nSome studies even have 40,000 participants that show those who drink three to five cups of tea a day have an increased lifespan, have a decreased all, cause mortality. That means dying from anything, has decreases in heart disease, decreases in strokes. \n\nBut before we get too excited, we need to remember correlation versus causation. Just because those who drink green tea live longer, it doesn’t mean green tea is the sole thing that’s responsible for that effect. \n\nSo, yes, enjoy your green tea, but don’t think you’re going to live forever. Here’s how you create the healthiest cup of tea possible. Don’t add green tea directly to boiling water as it destroys those healthy categories we’ve been talking about. \n\nDon’t go decaf because the decaffeination process hurts more of the nutrients found in green tea. Add lemon into your tea as it aid in the absorption of some of these nutrients.  ","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":5,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Lifestyle","slug":"lifestyle","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T18:56:54.291Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":10,"attributes":{"title":"Intermittent Fasting: Pros and cons","slug":"intermittent-fasting-pros-and-cons","createdAt":"2023-02-03T01:44:22.565Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-04T22:21:40.761Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-03T01:52:01.953Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/70497/pexels-photo-70497.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Our bodies enter a fasting state every time we’re asleep. Some people do intermittent fasting and do not even know it. I mean, there’s plenty of times where I had a stressful rotation in medical school or a difficult job in the hospital where I didn’t have time to eat breakfast. \n\nThat’s a form of intermittent fasting. And our bodies are totally capable of handling this. I know what you’re thinking. I don’t want to starve myself for health benefits. Intermittent fasting is not starving. \n\nWhen you’re fasting, your body is using stored nutrients and stored energy forms in order to make your body continue to function. When you’re starving, you run out of those energy sources and are breaking down vital tissues like organs to get that same energy. \n\nThere are many different ways to go about going on one of these diets. And that not only makes it confusing for you, but that also makes it very difficult to do research on it to find out how effective it truly is. \n\nBecause if there are multiple ways to do it, we have to be able to test each one of those ways. The 16/8 diet which is not eating during 16 hours of the day. Alternate day fasting, where you eat one day fast, the other day five and two were two days of the week that you’re fasting. \n\nThere’s no hard and fast rule saying that this is the correct way of doing it. You may be wondering how is IF beneficial to me? There’s been a lot of proposed health benefits. Many of them have been proven within animal studies or lab models, which is not the same thing as being proven in a human model, but they are very promising. \n\nNow, those benefits include increased mental sharpness, a favorable hormonal profile, weight loss. Decreases of inflammation within the body, decreases of certain diseases within the body. How can IF help you lose weight? \n\nYou have an increase in growth hormone, a decrease in insulin, and that alone will help you lose weight. Next, because you’re skipping meals or even going days without eating meals, it’s very likely that when you look throughout the week, you’ll be eating fewer calories. \n\nOur thinking is that during 8 hours you’ll eat less than you would if you were eating during 16 hours. Let’s talk about these other health benefits. We know that chronic stress is not good for the body. \n\nThe body is just not meant to be chronically stressed out. It’s not meant to have a high heart rate, high blood pressure. Intermittent fasting is really a form of acute short term mild stress. This type of acute short term stress is really good for the body. \n\nWhat can we use as a metaphor here? Let’s take exercise. Exercise is a form of acute mild stress. What happens after exercise? We have benefits for the brain. We have benefits for weight loss. We have benefits for disease prevention. \n\nNow, similarly, when you stress your body through intermittent fasting, there are some benefits. More autophagy, which is the removal of cellular waste, more production of neurotrophic factors, which protect your brain, and a favorable hormonal profile with increases in human growth hormone and norepinephrine. \n\nLet’s talk about some of the shortcomings of IF. Primarily, there’s not enough guidance on what you should eat. We don’t know how many calories. We don’t know what foods to eat on the days or times that you actually are eating. \n\nSecond, we don’t know which form of IF is best. Third, there are some side effects when you are fasting that people do experience heading aches, mental fog, heartburn. These things do exist. It’s not totally benign. \n\nFour. We don’t know the consequences of following an intermittent fasting diet long term. Most, if not all, of these studies are done on the short term. If you are eating a very unhealthy diet and then make a change, you’re definitely going to see a benefit. ","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":4,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Lifestyle","slug":"lifestyle","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T18:56:54.291Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":11,"attributes":{"title":"I went VEGAN For 30 Days | Here's How My Body Reacted...","slug":"i-went-vegan-for-30-days-here-s-how-my-body-reacted","createdAt":"2023-02-03T04:11:22.897Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-04T22:44:53.809Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-03T04:11:25.351Z","img":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1351238/pexels-photo-1351238.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=1","metaDesc":"Honestly, I was really proud of myself, and it’s nice every now and then to take a challenge like this and learn something new about yourself.  \nFive things I Learned to be vegan for 30 days ...\nIn fact, I want to tell you five things that I learned not only about the vegan diet but also about myself during this process. One, when I didn’t plan well; I ate very unhealthy when I was at MIT for breakfast. I ate cinnamon toast Crunch with almond milk and a banana every morning. That’s not healthy, even though it’s vegan. \nTwo, I didn’t notice a major change in my energy level like I thought I would. I mean, maybe I had a slightly decreased energy level, but we remember I was sick in the beginning. I was under eating calories, so I don’t feel it’s fair to blame vegan for that. \n\nThree, surprisingly, I didn’t get weaker on vegan. I was lifting strong, and I felt good. But what suffered was getting to the gym. I really noticed the lack of willpower when I was following the restrictive diet. \nFour, when it comes to my body, I lost 3 pound. I dropped from 203 to 200 pounds. So there was some weight loss, probably from under-eating calories, but despite losing weight, I didn’t feel as lean. I mean, all those sauces, all the rice that I ate, pasta that contributed to the car bloat and probably made me feel a little bit pudgier than usual. \nFive, this is the big one. The real difficulty was my GI system. I mean, it was a mess. The amount of gas and flatulence and bloating. God, I can’t. It’s, like, gross even talking about, but it was terrible. \n\nIf you have that with any diet, there’s no way you’re sticking with it. And I tried taking some over-the-counter supplements for this. It did absolutely nothing.\n\nMy advice to you .....\nIf you’re curious or interested in starting a vegan diet, I don’t want to dissuade you. In fact, I want to encourage you. Go talk to a dietitian nutritionist physician, someone who’s well versed in vegan diets. That way you could do it the healthy, happy, safe way without hurting yourself in the process. \nAnd please reduce the amount of refined carbs and processed foods that you’re eating, because as more research comes out, that’s the stuff that causes diseases and shortens your lifespan. And as always, stay happy and healthy. ","tags":["health","lifestyle"],"readTime":10,"category":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"title":"Lifestyle","slug":"lifestyle","createdAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:35.696Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T18:56:54.291Z","publishedAt":"2023-01-14T18:14:37.420Z","img":"https://images.freeimages.com/variants/r1kHNRt2vrPm4NK9McWGVTeZ/f4a36f6589a0e50e702740b15352bc00e4bfaf6f58bd4db850e167794d05993d"}}},"author":{"data":{"id":1,"attributes":{"username":"sarvesh","email":"sarvesh@gmail.com","provider":"local","confirmed":true,"blocked":false,"createdAt":"2023-01-10T18:16:01.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T01:13:02.561Z"}}}}},{"id":12,"attributes":{"title":"Real Cause of Chronic Kidney Disease and Polycystic Kidney Disease","slug":"real-cause-of-chronic-kidney-disease-and-polycystic-kidney-disease","createdAt":"2023-02-04T13:26:37.597Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-04T22:47:22.212Z","publishedAt":"2023-02-04T13:27:07.778Z","img":"https://advancedurology.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kidney-Stone-Signs-scaled.jpg","metaDesc":"Chronic kidney disease is mainly made up of several types of problems with the kidney.

And then you have another problem with kidney stones, which relates to kidney stones. So if you have any of these problems, this article is for you, and you definitely want to read it.\n\n Time restricted eating, which is basically intermittent fasting, also slowed down the progression of the cysts developing in the kidney and the associated fibrosis, or the scar tissue that then comes after. It was also found that the ketogenic diet reduces the risk of kidney stones as long as the person’s on a low oxalate diet. Oxalates are things that contribute to kidney stones, and they’re in spinach, the almonds, the chocolate, kiwi.\nMetformin has to do with regulating blood sugar by improving insulin resistance, another interesting association. Fastening strongly inhibits the fibrosis or scar tissue associated with these cysts, as well as inhibiting something called mTOR. mTOR is something in the body that can trigger the growth of cancer tumors and even cysts.
